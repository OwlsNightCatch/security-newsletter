ESET's months-long investigation into the Gentlemen ransomware-as-a-service operation reveals a structural departure from the affiliate norm: rather than each affiliate sourcing its own evasion tooling, the operators build, maintain and distribute a modular EDR-killing framework — *GentleKiller* — centrally ([ESET, 2026-06-18](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/killing-me-gently-inside-gentlemens-edr-killer-framework/); [Help Net Security, 2026-06-18](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/06/18/eset-gentlemen-edr-killers/)). GentleKiller comprises at least eight variants, each abusing a different legitimately-signed driver via BYOVD (`T1543.003`), targeting 400+ named security processes mapped to 48 EDR/AV/XDR product families. The defining operational pattern is speed: ESET documents the gang operationalising newly disclosed BYOVD proof-of-concepts within days of public release, and in one case wielding a Huawei-audio-driver kill technique *before* its public disclosure — ESET telemetry shows the gang using it since at least 2026-01-23, weeks ahead of the technique's public write-up (by Huntress) on 2026-03-19. Common evasion across variants includes Enigma/Themida packing and invalid copies of digital certificates impersonating major AV vendors; a Rust-based credential stealer (*OxideHarvest*) handles browser-credential theft. The gang reached top-5 most-active RaaS in Q1 2026, offers affiliates a 90% cut, and shows globally distributed victimology including Western Europe — a profile overlapping Swiss critical-sector exposure.
**Why it matters to us:** an operator-curated EDR-killer means affiliates of even modest skill get current BYOVD capability on day one of a PoC. Enable the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist (HVCI) and enforce WDAC driver allowlisting; hunt for service creation loading unexpected kernel drivers and `DeviceIoControl` calls from non-security processes, plus process-termination loops targeting security software (Sysmon EID 6 / kernel-callback telemetry).
