Microsoft Threat Intelligence documented a multi-component campaign (detected as `Trojan:Win32/CryptoBandits.A`/B and `Trojan:JS/CryptoBandits.A`/B), active since at least February 2026, that pairs a removable-media worm with a Tor-fronted clipboard hijacker ([Microsoft Security, 2026-06-17](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/06/17/crypto-clipper-uses-tor-worm-like-propagation-for-persistence-control/); [The Hacker News, 2026-06-18](https://thehackernews.com/2026/06/microsoft-details-windows-clipper.html)). The worm scans attached USB drives for `.doc`/`.xlsx`/`.pdf` files, sets the originals hidden, and replaces them with same-named `.lnk` shortcuts that launch the payload on user interaction — the classic air-gap-crossing removable-media vector. Once resident, it establishes scheduled-task persistence, launches a renamed portable Tor client opening a SOCKS5 proxy on `localhost:9050`, and beacons to `.onion` hidden services over three HTTP endpoints (`/route.php` beacon, `/recvf.php` upload, `/stub.php` payload). The clipboard component polls for cryptocurrency addresses (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, Monero) and silently swaps them, and the C2 supports an `EVAL` remote-code-execution command.
**Why it matters to us:** the crypto-theft payload is secondary to the propagation model — USB-LNK worms have historically reached isolated and air-gapped administrative environments still common in Swiss public-sector data-transfer workflows, and Tor-fronted C2 defeats domain/IP egress blocking. Detection: `WScript`/`CScript` spawning `curl.exe`/`cmd.exe`/`powershell.exe`; outbound SOCKS5 to `localhost:9050`; scheduled-task creation referencing obfuscated script payloads. Hardening: enforce `NoAutorun`/`NoDriveTypeAutorun`, block LNK execution from removable media via ASR, restrict `wscript.exe`/`cscript.exe` to signed scripts, and block Tor egress.
