A coordinated law-enforcement action on 2026-06-18 — an expansion of the May 2024 Operation Endgame — dismantled infrastructure tied to TA569, the long-running operator of the SocGholish (FakeUpdates) initial-access framework ([Politie, 2026-06-18](https://www.politie.nl/en/news/2026/juni/18/11-international-law-enforcement-initiate-hunt-on-malware-group-socgholish.html); [Help Net Security, 2026-06-18](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/06/18/law-enforcement-socgholish-operation-endgame/)). The Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit led the operation with the RCMP, FBI, BKA and Europol; 106 command-and-control servers were taken down and the malicious JavaScript loader was removed from 14,971 compromised WordPress sites. SocGholish injects obfuscated JavaScript into legitimate WordPress sites (typically via stolen `wp-admin` credentials or vulnerable plugins), fingerprints visitors and renders a fake browser-update lure; accepting it drives a ZIP download of a `.js`/`.lnk` stage-1 that executes through `wscript.exe` or `mshta.exe` (`T1189` Drive-by Compromise → `T1059.007` JavaScript → `T1204.002` User Execution), historically passing access to Evil Corp downstream affiliates ([Proofpoint, 2026-06-18](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/sayonara-socgholish-operation-endgame-disrupts-major-cybercrime-operation)). This is the first Endgame phase to directly target the FakeUpdates component, an initial-access mechanism in continuous use since roughly 2017.
**Defender takeaway:** the takedown does not retire the technique — hunt for `wscript.exe`/`mshta.exe` spawned from a browser process (Sysmon EID 1, high-fidelity), correlate web-proxy logs for browser-initiated downloads of `.zip` payloads from WordPress hosts, and audit `wp-admin` credentials plus theme-file integrity on any WordPress estate you operate.
