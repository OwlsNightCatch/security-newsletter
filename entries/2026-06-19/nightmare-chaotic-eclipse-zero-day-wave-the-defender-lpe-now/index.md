**UPDATE (originally covered in the 2026-W24 weekly summary):** The serialised Windows zero-day campaign tracked as Nightmare/Chaotic Eclipse has a new, formally-identified entry: *RoguePlanet*, the local elevation-of-privilege flaw in the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine (`mpengine.dll`, used by Defender on all supported Windows 10/11), is now assigned **CVE-2026-50656**, acknowledged by Microsoft, and rated *Exploitation More Likely* on the MSRC Exploitability Index ([Microsoft MSRC, 2026-06-16](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2026-50656); [Help Net Security, 2026-06-17](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2026/06/17/rogueplanet-zero-day-cve-2026-50656/)).

The exploit abuses a TOCTOU race: during a scan Defender resolves a file path and later reopens it for analysis, and the PoC swaps in a malicious file in that window to obtain a SYSTEM shell. It requires only local low-privilege access, needs no user interaction, and the researcher states it functions regardless of whether real-time protection is enabled — though the race makes it non-deterministic ("hit or miss") ([The Hacker News, 2026-06-17](https://thehackernews.com/2026/06/microsoft-confirms-rogueplanet-defender_02022423645.html)). As of 2026-06-18 Microsoft states a fix is in development with no timeline; the public PoC is the in-window delta.
