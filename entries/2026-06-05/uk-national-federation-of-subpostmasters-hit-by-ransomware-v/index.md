The UK **National Federation of Subpostmasters (NFSP)** was struck by ransomware around 30 April 2026 after attackers exploited a vulnerability in **cPanel** to gain initial access, manipulate server-side files, and lock out administrative accounts before deploying ransomware ([Computer Weekly, 2026-06-04](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366643958/Subpostmaster-federation-hit-by-ransomware-attack); [Risky Business, 2026-06-05](https://news.risky.biz/risky-bulletin-the-eu-debuts-digital-sovereignty-plan/)). As of early June the parent Post Office had suspended all email to and from the `@nfsp.org.uk` domain as a precaution; NFSP says no data was lost and reported the incident to the ICO. The entry vector is the operative detail: cPanel — ubiquitous in shared hosting and small-org infrastructure — remains under-patched, and authentication-bypass / privilege-escalation flaws in it map cleanly to `T1190` (Exploit Public-Facing Application) followed by `T1486` (Data Encrypted for Impact).

**Defender takeaway:** any internet-facing cPanel instance is a ransomware on-ramp. Pin cPanel to the current release (the vendor ships frequent security updates), disable unused modules, and alert on admin-account lockouts and anomalous file-manager / FTP modification events in hosting-management interfaces. Small public-sector-adjacent bodies running their own web hosting are the soft targets here.
