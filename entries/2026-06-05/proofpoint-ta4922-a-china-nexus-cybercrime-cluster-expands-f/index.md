Proofpoint reports that **TA4922**, a Chinese-speaking, financially-motivated cluster it assesses as running the highest campaign tempo of any cybercrime actor it tracks, expanded in March–April 2026 from its historical Japanese focus to localised campaigns against UK, German, Italian and South African organisations ([The Hacker News, 2026-06-04](https://thehackernews.com/2026/06/china-linked-ta4922-expands-phishing.html); [BleepingComputer, 2026-06-04](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/chinese-hackers-use-new-atlas-rat-malware-in-european-cyberattacks/)). Lures are carefully tailored in the target's native language — tax-authority, HR/payroll and invoice themes — and the toolkit now pairs the known **ValleyRAT (Winos 4.0)** with newly observed families: **Atlas RAT** (a C-based RAT) and **RomulusLoader**, which DLL-side-loads (`T1574.002`) AnyDesk and SyncFuture, plus **SilentRunLoader**, a Python infostealer pulling Chrome credentials and cookies (`T1555.003`). A notable TTP shift is the deliberate move of conversations to **LINE, WhatsApp and Microsoft Teams** to pull targets off enterprise email controls before payload delivery.

**Why it matters to us:** German and UK targeting with native-language tax/payroll lures puts DACH public-sector and finance staff squarely in scope. Hunt for DLL side-loading chains where trusted binaries (AnyDesk, SyncFuture) load from unexpected working directories, for Python processes reaching DPAPI / Chrome credential stores, and for unsolicited inbound contact on LINE/WhatsApp/Teams that pivots to a "document" — the out-of-band channel is where the email gateway loses visibility.
