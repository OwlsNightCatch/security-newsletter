summary: "TeamPCP (UNC6780) backdoors the Checkmarx Jenkins AST plugin — third Checkmarx supply-chain compromise in three months. Malicious plugin build 2026.5.09 published to the Jenkins Marketplace on 2026-05-09–10 deploys SANDCLOCK to exfiltrate every CI secret reachable from the runner (cloud keys, container-registry credentials, Checkmarx API tokens) (The Hacker News, 2026-05-11; Checkmarx — Ongoing Security Updates, last update 2026-05-09). Treat any pipeline that auto-updated in the window as a full secrets-compromise event."

**UPDATE (TeamPCP / mini-shai-hulud first covered 2026-05-07; PCPJack worm covered 2026-05-10; this is a distinct new artefact in the same actor ecosystem):** On 2026-05-09–10 (UTC) TeamPCP (UNC6780) published a backdoored build of the Checkmarx Jenkins AST plugin (version `2026.5.09`, marketed under the actor's signature naming "Checkmarx-Fully-Hacked-by-TeamPCP") to the Jenkins Marketplace. Any Jenkins instance configured to auto-update the AST plugin during that window pulled the malicious build and executed the **SANDCLOCK** credential stealer in the runner context ([Checkmarx — Ongoing Security Updates, last updated 2026-05-09](https://checkmarx.com/blog/ongoing-security-updates/); [The Hacker News, 2026-05-11](https://thehackernews.com/2026/05/teampcp-compromises-checkmarx-jenkins.html); [SecurityWeek, 2026-05-11](https://www.securityweek.com/checkmarx-jenkins-ast-plugin-compromised-in-supply-chain-attack/)).

SANDCLOCK targets every secret reachable from a typical CI/CD pipeline environment: GitHub Personal Access Tokens, AWS / Azure / GCP credentials, Kubernetes service-account tokens, Docker / OCI registry credentials, SSH keys, and Checkmarx One API tokens. Affected pipelines should be treated as **full secrets-compromise** events: every credential the runner could read must be rotated and any artefact built or deployed in the window audited. Checkmarx's [ongoing-security-updates page](https://checkmarx.com/blog/ongoing-security-updates/) specifies plugin version `2.0.13-829.vc72453fa_1c16` (published December 2025) as the safe pinned version; a CVE has been issued as CVE-2026-33634 per the Checkmarx advisory. This is the **third** Checkmarx-product supply-chain compromise by this actor in three months, after the March 2026 KICS Docker image and the April 2026 VS Code extension defacement — the cadence and the actor's naming convention indicate persistent targeting of the Checkmarx product line specifically, not opportunistic distribution-channel abuse.

Mapped to [T1195.002 Compromise Software Supply Chain](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/002/) and [T1552.001 Credentials In Files](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001/). The GTIG AI Threat Tracker ( attributes SANDCLOCK specifically to TeamPCP and flags the stealer as explicitly designed to harvest **LLM API keys** in addition to traditional cloud credentials — consistent with the actor's pivot to monetising stolen LLM access. Defender pivot: inventory every Jenkins plugin auto-update enabled across CI/CD estates; constrain runners to short-lived OIDC-federated credentials (no long-lived PATs in runner env) where the platform supports it; audit Checkmarx One API logs for unexpected source IPs since 2026-05-09.
