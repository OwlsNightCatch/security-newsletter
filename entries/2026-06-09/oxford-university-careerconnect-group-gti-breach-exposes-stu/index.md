The University of Oxford disclosed a breach after Group GTI, the third-party provider of the CareerConnect career-services platform, reported its systems were compromised on 28 May 2026 ([BleepingComputer, 2026-06-08](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oxford-university-discloses-data-breach-after-careerconnect-platform-hack/); [Oxford Careers Service, 2026-06-01](https://www.careers.ox.ac.uk/article/careerconnect-secured-and-safe-to-use-following-data-security-incident)). Exposed data includes student first names, last names and email addresses; for users who do not authenticate via institutional Single Sign-On, encrypted passwords were also taken. CareerConnect is used by Oxford, King's College London and the University of Manchester among others, so the breach spans multiple UK higher-education institutions ([BleepingComputer, 2026-06-08](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oxford-university-discloses-data-breach-after-careerconnect-platform-hack/)); The Register notes further unnamed UK and overseas institutions are affected ([The Register, 2026-06-06](https://www.theregister.com/security/2026/06/06/oxford-university-data-pwned-again-by-career-platform-breach/5251754)). GTI assessed the intrusion as credential-harvest oriented, raising the likelihood of follow-on phishing against institutional email addresses.

**Defender takeaway:** SSO adoption directly limited blast radius here — SSO users' passwords stayed with the identity provider, leaving only names and emails exposed. The case reinforces segregation of authentication credentials away from in-app stores and treating shared SaaS career/HR platforms as part of the institutional attack surface. Swiss *Hochschulen* using shared SaaS career portals should expect targeted phishing waves against the harvested address sets.
