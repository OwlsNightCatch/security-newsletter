  TeamPCP open-sources its Mini Shai-Hulud supply-chain framework on GitHub, spawning a new
  "Phantom Gyp" derivative and underscoring that valid SLSA provenance does not survive a
  subverted build environment (SANS ISC, 2026-06-08).

**UPDATE (originally covered 2026-06-06):** A SANS ISC handler diary tracking the TeamPCP supply-chain campaign through 7 June reports the operators have open-sourced their Mini Shai-Hulud framework on GitHub, triggering a second wave of derivative campaigns ([SANS ISC, 2026-06-08](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/33060)). Beyond the previously-covered Miasma worm — which compromised npm packages including Red Hat's `@redhat-cloud-services` scope ([Wiz, 2026-06-01](https://www.wiz.io/blog/miasma-supply-chain-attack-targeting-redhat-npm-packages)) — the diary names a newly-tracked **Phantom Gyp** campaign that abuses `node-gyp` / `binding.gyp` install-time script execution in compromised npm packages; both inject malicious CI/CD hooks ([SANS ISC, 2026-06-08](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/33060)).

The diary's load-bearing detection-engineering point: valid SLSA provenance attestations do not protect against supply-chain injection when the build environment itself is subverted from the inside. The recommended shift is from attestation-verification to build-pipeline integrity — monitor GitHub Actions runner process trees for unexpected outbound network from within a build, alert on `actions/upload-artifact` shipping signed-but-anomalous binaries, and cross-check published package checksums against CI logs via independent transparency ledgers (e.g. Sigstore Rekor). EU/Swiss public-sector teams running npm-based automation or Red Hat tooling should audit CI/CD pipeline definitions for unexpected workflow-step insertions.

## Update — 2026-06-27T05:17:51Z

The Miasma / Mini Shai-Hulud / Hades supply-chain worm — last seen backdooring `@redhat-cloud-services` packages and the TeamPCP "Phantom Gyp" framework — ran a fresh wave on 2026-06-24: 23+ malicious versions across the LeoPlatform and RStreams serverless-data-pipeline npm ecosystems (`leo-sdk`, `leo-auth`, `leo-aws`, `leo-cli`) after the `czirker` publisher account was compromised, plus a Go-module compromise of Verana Blockchain ([Socket Security, 2026-06-25](https://socket.dev/blog/miasma-mini-shai-hulud-hits-leoplatform-npm-packages-go-ecosystem)).

The wave reuses the previously documented `binding.gyp`/`node-gyp` install-time execution to stage a Bun runtime that harvests `.env` files, npm/GitHub/cloud tokens, SSH keys and IDE/AI-agent configs, scraping GitHub Actions CI secrets ([JFrog, 2026-06-26](https://research.jfrog.com/post/shai-hulud-miasma-alright-lets-see-if-this-works/)), and again carries the `RevokeAndItGoesKaboom` campaign marker that Socket ties to the earlier `codfish/semantic-release-action` compromise (documented by StepSecurity), where the malicious action searched GitHub commit messages bearing that string as an operator dead-drop channel ([Socket Security, 2026-06-25](https://socket.dev/blog/miasma-mini-shai-hulud-hits-leoplatform-npm-packages-go-ecosystem)). Any CH/EU team consuming these packages in CI should rotate all exposed CI/cloud credentials since 2026-06-20 and alert on `node-gyp` evaluating JavaScript from `binding.gyp`.
