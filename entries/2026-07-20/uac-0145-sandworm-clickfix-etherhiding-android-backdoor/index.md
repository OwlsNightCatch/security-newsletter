headline: "GRU's Sandworm adopts ClickFix, blockchain-hidden C2 (EtherHiding) and a Signal-lured Android backdoor — transferable tradecraft for EU CI defenders"
summary: >
  CERT-UA reports UAC-0145, a subcluster of Sandworm (APT44 / Seashell Blizzard, GRU),
  compromised at least 10 legitimate websites in June–July 2026 to serve a fake CAPTCHA
  that coerces visitors into pasting a PowerShell command (ClickFix), staging VBS
  persistence and Python backdoors. The injected CAPTCHA resolves its content domain via
  an Ethereum smart-contract call (EtherHiding) to survive takedowns, and the group
  separately distributes a full-featured Android backdoor (COWARDDUCK) via Signal disguised
  as security software. Primary targeting is Ukraine, but Sandworm is a standing threat to
  European CI/government and the technique stack is directly transferable.

No attacker-controlled indicators are reproduced (no-IOC policy); abused legitimate platforms are named only as technique."

CERT-UA reports that UAC-0145 — a subcluster of UAC-0002 / Sandworm (APT44, Seashell Blizzard), the GRU-linked destructive-actor family — compromised at least 10 legitimate websites between June and July 2026 to serve a fake CAPTCHA that instructs visitors to paste and run a PowerShell command in the ClickFix pattern ([The Hacker News, 2026-07-19](https://thehackernews.com/2026/07/uac-0145-uses-clickfix-captchas-to.html)). The PowerShell one-liner drops a VBS persistence stub into the Startup folder — "one of the variants of such a program was called GHETTOVIBE," per CERT-UA — which stages a PowerShell reconnaissance script (SCOUTCURL) that profiles the host, while two loaders, FLUIDLEECH (masquerading as software for removing computer viruses) and LOADLOOP, fetch a Python backdoor, FREAKYPOLL ([The Hacker News, 2026-07-19](https://thehackernews.com/2026/07/uac-0145-uses-clickfix-captchas-to.html)). The compromised-site injection uses a bespoke tool, SMARTAXE, layered on the commodity Cloaking.House traffic-filtering service to serve different content by visitor; the injected CAPTCHA "content to be injected into the web page employs the EtherHiding technique to retrieve the domain name of the remote resource from an Ethereum smart contract" ([The Hacker News, 2026-07-19](https://thehackernews.com/2026/07/uac-0145-uses-clickfix-captchas-to.html)) — a `eth_call`-style read that replaces a hardcoded C2 domain and survives takedowns because the resolution layer lives on-chain.

Separately, UAC-0145 distributes a full-featured Android backdoor, COWARDDUCK, via Signal disguised as security software; it collects contacts, files matching targeted extensions, and real-time geolocation, uploading via the Dropbox API and pulling C2 tasking from content hosted on legitimate services (e.g. Steam Community) proxied through a public search-engine proxy — both chosen to blend into normal outbound traffic ([CERT-UA, 2026-07-19](https://cert.gov.ua/article/6318437)). CERT-UA frames this as a continuation of its multi-year UAC-0145 tracking; the group's earlier tradecraft (trojanized torrent installers, Signal "antivirus" lures) is background — the in-window delta is the ClickFix vector, the EtherHiding C2-resolution layer, and the COWARDDUCK mobile backdoor. The ClickFix pivot marks a departure from Sandworm's prior reliance on trojanized Windows/Office installers ([The Hacker News, 2026-07-19](https://thehackernews.com/2026/07/uac-0145-uses-clickfix-captchas-to.html)).

**Defender takeaway:** Sandworm is a standing threat to European critical infrastructure and government, so this technique stack matters to EU/Swiss defenders even though the current victims are in Ukraine. Hunt on the desktop chain: a Startup-folder VBS created around the time a browser presents a "CAPTCHA" asking the user to open Win+R or a terminal and paste text; PowerShell child processes of `explorer.exe` or a browser with no prior parent-child history (process-creation telemetry with lineage — Sysmon EID 1, EDR process events); and, for the EtherHiding tell, outbound `eth_call`-style JSON-RPC traffic to public Ethereum nodes originating from endpoints rather than developer tooling. For mobile fleets, treat Signal-delivered APKs claiming to be AV/security tools as hostile, and watch BYOD/MDM egress for the Dropbox-API-plus-legitimate-platform C2 pattern. **Triage:** developer and IT-admin hosts legitimately spawn PowerShell from many parents and legitimately query blockchain nodes — the discriminators are (1) the PowerShell instance being a child of a browser/`explorer` immediately after a web CAPTCHA prompt, paired with a new Startup-folder VBS, and (2) `eth_call` traffic from a general-purpose endpoint with no Web3 developer role; either alone is weak, the sequence is the signal.
