title: "Ubiquiti UniFi ecosystem: 22 CVEs in one bulletin, three at CVSS 10.0 — unauthenticated CRLF-injection auth bypass, and unauthenticated command injection in UniFi Protect and UniFi Talk"
headline: "Ubiquiti's August bulletin carries three separate unauthenticated maximum-severity flaws across its OS, video and telephony product lines in one release"
summary: >
  Ubiquiti's Security Advisory Bulletin 067 (2026-08-27) fixes 22 CVEs across the UniFi
  OS/Protect/Talk/Access/Network/Connect ecosystem. Three score CVSS 10.0: an authentication
  bypass via CRLF injection in UniFi OS devices, and unauthenticated command injection each in
  UniFi Protect and UniFi Talk. A further ten score 9.9–9.8. Vendor patches are available for the
  full set; NCSC-CH records current exploitation status as unknown, but notes a prior UniFi patch
  cycle was under criminal attack within weeks.

NCSC Switzerland's Cyber Security Hub published an advisory on 2026-08-27 transcribing Ubiquiti's Security Advisory Bulletin 067: 22 CVEs across the UniFi OS/Protect/Talk/Access/Network/Connect ecosystem, many at maximum severity. The three CVSS 10.0 entries are CVE-2026-77550 (authentication bypass via CRLF injection in UniFi OS devices), CVE-2026-77537 (unauthenticated command injection in UniFi Protect), and CVE-2026-77554 (unauthenticated command injection in UniFi Talk). A further ten CVEs score 9.9–9.8 (CVSS 3.1), spanning authenticated command injection in UniFi Access/Protect, privilege escalation via improper access control in UniFi OS/UniFi Protect AI Key, and unauthenticated command injection in the UniFi Enterprise Audio/Video Bridge. All require only network access to UniFi OS management interfaces or applications; the unauthenticated entries need no privilege at all, while the authenticated command-injection entries need low or high privilege depending on the flaw.

Vendor patches are available for the full set — per Heise Security's reporting: UniFi OS Server 5.1.37, UniFi Protect 7.2.105, UniFi Talk 5.3.2, UniFi Access 4.3.5, UniFi Network 10.5.67 ([Heise Security, 2026-08-27](https://www.heise.de/news/Ubiquiti-schliesst-mehrere-kritische-Sicherheitsluecken-11431726.html)). NCSC-CH records current exploitation status as unknown for this batch: "successful exploitation could allow network-adjacent attackers to completely compromise affected devices, leading to full system takeover via authentication bypass, command injection, or privilege escalation" ([NCSC Switzerland Cyber Security Hub, 2026-08-27](https://community.ui.com/releases/Security-Advisory-Bulletin-067/fc4a3488-7c43-4628-8bab-f715e96dbfc9)) — but Heise notes historical context that argues against reading "unknown" as "safe": Ubiquiti UniFi OS vulnerabilities from a May 2026 patch cycle were already under criminal attack by the end of June 2026, so a comparably fast exploitation timeline for this batch should be actively watched for rather than assumed absent.

UniFi is heavily deployed in SME and public-sector network, access-control and video-surveillance infrastructure across Europe, and its product breadth — OS management plane, physical access control, video surveillance, telephony — means this single bulletin touches several distinct functional surfaces in the same estate at once. **Triage:** in the absence of a published exploitation narrative, the defensible detection posture is process- and configuration-anomaly monitoring on UniFi OS management interfaces — unexpected administrative session creation not tied to a known operator login, and command-execution telemetry on the underlying host that does not correspond to a documented UniFi OS operation — since the vendor has not yet published the specific request patterns an exploit would use.
