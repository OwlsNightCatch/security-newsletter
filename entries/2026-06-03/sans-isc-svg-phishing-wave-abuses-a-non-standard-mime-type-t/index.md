SANS ISC handler Xavier Mertens documented a fresh wave of phishing emails carrying SVG attachments whose embedded JavaScript is obfuscated with combined Base64 + XOR encoding and, on decode, redirects the victim via `window.location.href` to a credential-harvesting page ([SANS ISC, 2026-06-02](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/33040)). The notable evasion is the use of `<script type="application/ecmascript">` instead of the standard `text/javascript` — browsers execute both identically, but email-security and WAF products that pattern-match specifically on `text/javascript` can miss the non-standard declaration. Because SVGs open natively in Windows browsers, the redirect fires on file open with no extra click. [SINGLE-SOURCE] (SANS Internet Storm Center). Detection: flag email attachments of `Content-Type: image/svg+xml` that contain embedded `<script>` elements; treat the `application/ecmascript`/`application/javascript` MIME variants as equivalent to `text/javascript` in inspection rules; sandbox SVG attachments before delivery and watch newly-registered low-cost TLDs (the campaign used a `.cfd` domain) at the proxy.
