Unit 42 enumerates seven cloud-logging attack categories — five evasion, two visibility ([Unit 42, 2026-06-09](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloud-logging-defense-evasion/)). Evasion techniques: stopping CloudTrail trails (`StopLogging`), deleting S3/GCS log destinations, removing GCP log-routing sinks, impairing customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) so logs become unreadable, and log poisoning to mask activity with benign-looking entries; visibility techniques redirect logs to attacker accounts via cross-account delivery for long-term reconnaissance of defender detections (T1562.008, T1070, T1530). Hardening: S3 Object Lock / GCS locked-bucket immutable retention; IAM restrictions on `cloudtrail:StopLogging`, `cloudtrail:DeleteTrail`, `logging.sinks.delete`; alert on `cloudtrail:UpdateTrail` modifying KMS-key associations and on KMS key-policy changes affecting CloudTrail encryption. Log-integrity monitoring is a NIS2 incident-detection expectation, making this directly relevant to EU cloud-resident public-sector and financial workloads. [SINGLE-SOURCE] (Unit 42 primary research).
