Check Point Research details a malware-distribution operation that impersonates open-source reversing tools using CloudFront-hosted JavaScript to hijack download clicks and route victims through a Traffic Distribution System enforcing geo/device/VPN/frequency filtering before delivering one of three payloads ([Check Point Research, 2026-06-03](https://research.checkpoint.com/2026/impersonation-click-hijacking-and-tds-inside-a-malware-distribution-ecosystem/)). The payloads are SessionGate (a per-session multi-stage loader with AES-encrypted modules), RemusStealer (targeting 20+ browsers, 220+ wallet extensions, 77 password-manager extensions and 18 2FA tools), and AnimateClipper (a clipboard hijacker with on-chain C2). The targeting is notable for this audience: it goes after security researchers and developers searching for trusted tools, bypassing standard phishing-awareness training (T1566, T1204, T1555, T1111). Hunt for `ghidra`/`dnspy`/`ilspy` download-then-execute chains under browser child processes and clipboard-API access from unexpected processes. [SINGLE-SOURCE] (Check Point primary research).
