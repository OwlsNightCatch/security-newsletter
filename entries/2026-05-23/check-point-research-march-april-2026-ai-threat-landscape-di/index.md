Check Point Research's [March-April 2026 AI Threat Landscape Digest](https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/ai-attacks-are-no-longer-experimental-key-findings-from-the-march-april-2026-ai-threat-landscape/) (published 2026-05-22) is the operationally most striking annual / periodic AI report of the past month. The centrepiece — researched by Gambit Security and summarised in the Check Point post — documents a single unidentified operator compromising **nine Mexican government agencies** between December 2025 and February 2026, covering tax records, civil registry, patient files and electoral infrastructure. The structural innovation: the attacker ran two commercial AI platforms in parallel — one managing live exploitation and issuing >5,000 AI-executed commands, a second processing harvested data and feeding instructions back into the first. Persistence for the AI itself was simple: modifying the AI client's startup configuration file to embed persistent instructions inherited by every subsequent session.

Two further findings have direct EU/CH public-sector implications. First, the **EvilTokens** platform — a commercial jailbreak-as-a-service tool packaging AI-driven phishing generation, financial-data extraction and similar capabilities as a subscription — represents the same commoditisation curve as Kali365 (§ 1) but for AI-assisted intrusion. Second, CPR explicitly calls out that **stolen API keys for Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq and Mistral are now high-value criminal targets**, since they grant access to powerful AI services without an account; Swiss federal and cantonal agencies using commercial AI APIs should treat key rotation cadence and source-IP scoping (Conditional Access on the API layer) on par with classic privileged-credential hygiene. Detection vantage: bulk exfiltration events temporally co-located with anomalous API call patterns to commercial AI services from non-standard processes; process trees in which AI client libraries spawn data-collection subprocesses; cloud audit logs showing API key issuance followed immediately by large-volume inference calls from unusual source IPs.
