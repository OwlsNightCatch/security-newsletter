Canadian authorities (Ontario Provincial Police) arrested Jacob Butler, 23, of Ottawa — alias **Dort** — earlier this week on a U.S. extradition warrant; the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed the criminal complaint in the District of Alaska on **Thursday 2026-05-21** ([U.S. Department of Justice, 2026-05-21](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ak/pr/canadian-man-arrested-international-authorities-charged-administrating-kimwolf-ddos) · [KrebsOnSecurity, 2026-05-22](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/05/alleged-kimwolf-botmaster-dort-arrested-charged-in-u-s-and-canada/) · [The Record, 2026-05-22](https://therecord.media/canadian-man-arrested-charged-running-kimwolf-botnet)). Butler is alleged to have developed and operated **Kimwolf**, a DDoS-for-hire botnet assessed as a variant of AISURU. Kimwolf infected primarily consumer IoT — digital photo frames, webcams and other internet-exposed devices — via default credentials and known public CVEs, issued more than 25,000 DDoS attack commands, and peaked at **nearly 30 Tbps** per the DOJ and KrebsOnSecurity (The Hacker News reports the peak as 31.4 Tbps — the discrepancy is between the DOJ-cited figure used in the unsealed complaint and a secondary number cited by THN; treat the DOJ number as the reference for capacity-planning purposes). Targets included U.S. Department of Defense IP ranges and at least one victim with confirmed losses exceeding $1 million per incident. Kimwolf C2 infrastructure was seized 2026-03-19 in a coordinated multi-jurisdiction action alongside three sibling botnets — AISURU, JackSkid and Mossad — collectively infecting >3 million devices.

The complaint also documents that Butler conducted DDoS, doxing and swatting attacks against researchers who investigated him, including Synthient's Ben Brundage who had helped identify a Kimwolf-exploited vulnerability. Defender takeaway for Swiss and EU operators: the 30 Tbps capability is now demonstrably in range of a single operator's commercial service, and DDoS-for-hire infrastructure reorganises within weeks of takedowns. Re-baseline ISP scrubbing SLAs against a 10–30 Tbps reference, audit citizen-facing portals' application-layer rate limits, and segment consumer-grade IoT (frames, cameras, NVRs) off any path that touches critical infrastructure or admin networks.

**Why it matters to us:** Kimwolf belongs to the IoT-amplification class of botnets that target Swiss/EU public-sector portals; the arrest is an opportunity to re-test scrubbing capacity and IoT segmentation, not to assume the supply has shrunk.
