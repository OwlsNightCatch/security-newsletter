The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department disclosed on 2026-06-18/19 that a breach at an unnamed third-party vendor handling hunting and fishing licence sales exposed 3,087,721 customers' names, driver's-licence numbers, passport numbers, email addresses, phone numbers and residential addresses ([BleepingComputer, 2026-06-19](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/texas-govt-data-breach-exposes-over-3-million-drivers-licenses/)). The Texas Cyber Command flagged the intrusion (reported 13 May). TPWD's public statement said Social Security numbers were *not* involved — but The Register reviewed the agency's own filing to the Texas Attorney General's breach portal and reports it contradicts that, indicating SSNs *were* included ([The Register, 2026-06-19](https://www.theregister.com/security/2026/06/19/texas-gov-vendor-breach-exposes-data-of-3m-hunters-anglers/5258815)). The vendor remains unnamed; Kroll is providing credit monitoring.

**Defender takeaway:** A government agency that minimised breach scope in its public notice while its regulator filing shows broader exposure is the operationally instructive part. Public-sector bodies contracting licence/registry SaaS — including Swiss cantonal systems — should require contractual breach-notification timelines, SOC 2 Type II attestation, and segmentation guarantees on the licence database, and should reconcile public statements against regulator filings before publishing.
