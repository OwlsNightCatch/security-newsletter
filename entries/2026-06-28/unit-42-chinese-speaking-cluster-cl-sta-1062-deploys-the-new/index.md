Palo Alto Unit 42 (2026-06-25) documented **CL-STA-1062**, a Chinese-speaking cluster overlapping with Cisco Talos's UAT-7237, targeting government and state-owned energy infrastructure across Southeast Asia ([Unit 42, 2026-06-25](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cl-sta-1062-tinyrct-backdoor/); [The Hacker News, 2026-06-26](https://thehackernews.com/2026/06/chinese-speaking-apt-deploys-new.html)). Initial access is via internet-facing web apps and ASPX web shells (`T1505.003`), pivoting to a custom .NET backdoor, **TinyRCT**, delivered through AppDomainManager injection (`T1574.014`): a benign signed `chrome_setup.exe` ships in a ZIP alongside a malicious `chrome_setup.exe.config`, causing the .NET CLR to load `MyAppDomainManager.dll` from the same directory and bootstrap TinyRCT *in-process* — no child process, so it is low-visibility to EDR. TinyRCT beacons over HTTP with AES-128-CBC payloads, supports command execution via `cmd.exe`, chunked file exfiltration, and screen capture, and self-terminates unless run from `%LOCALAPPDATA%` or `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads` (anti-sandbox). Observed tooling includes Mimikatz, JuicyPotato and SoftEther VPN masqueraded as `vmtools.exe`. The defender value is the technique: `T1574.014` AppDomainManager injection is widely under-detected, and the same web-shell-to-in-process-.NET pattern is directly applicable to European public-sector web estates. Hunt for .NET `.config` files written into user-writable directories adjacent to signed executables, and DLL loads of `MyAppDomainManager.dll` from a signed PE's own directory (Sysmon EID 7).
