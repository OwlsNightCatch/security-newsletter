summary: "Two more CI/CD supply-chain incidents — actions-cool/issues-helper GitHub Action (exfil infrastructure overlapping with the Mini Shai-Hulud cluster per Socket) and Nx Console VS Code extension (stolen publisher credentials, no cluster attribution). 53 issues-helper tags moved to imposter commit 1c9e803 reading /proc/<PID>/mem of Runner.Worker for secrets exfil (StepSecurity, 2026-05-18). Nx Console 18.95.0 (2.2 M installs) compromised via stolen publisher credentials for an 11-minute window 2026-05-18 12:36–12:47 UTC (The Hacker News, 2026-05-19)."

StepSecurity disclosed on [2026-05-18](https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/actions-cool-issues-helper-github-action-compromised-all-tags-point-to-imposter-commit-that-exfiltrates-ci-cd-credentials) that all 53 existing version tags of the popular `actions-cool/issues-helper` GitHub Action were moved to point to an imposter commit (`1c9e803`) not present in the action's normal branch history, with 15 tags on the companion `actions-cool/maintain-one-comment` action manipulated in the same operation. The malicious payload downloads the Bun JavaScript runtime to the runner, then spawns a Python process that reads the **`/proc/<PID>/mem` address space of the Runner.Worker process** — the GitHub Actions component that holds decrypted workflow secrets during job execution. Captured bytes are filtered via `tr` + `grep` for values marked `isSecret: true` and exfiltrated over HTTPS to `t.m-kosche[.]com`. Socket confirmed the exfiltration domain overlaps with the **Mini Shai-Hulud** npm / PyPI campaign cluster ([The Hacker News, 2026-05-19](https://thehackernews.com/2026/05/github-actions-supply-chain-attack.html)). All 53 imposter commits were created within a 3-minute 16-second window; GitHub has since disabled the repository.

Any workflow that referenced `actions-cool/issues-helper@v*` or a mutable tag during the 2026-05-18 attack window should be treated as a compromised CI/CD pipeline — rotate GitHub PATs, npm tokens, AWS credentials, SSH keys, and any other secret exposed via `${{ secrets.* }}` to that workflow. Maps to T1195.002 (Compromise Software Supply Chain) and T1552.001 (Credentials in Files).

**Why it matters to us:** EU and Swiss developer organisations using GitHub Actions for public-sector software supply chains were directly in scope during the attack window. The mitigation is enforcement of **commit-SHA pinning** for every third-party Action reference (`uses: actions-cool/issues-helper@<full-sha>` rather than `@v2` or `@main`) and runtime enforcement of allow-listed outbound network destinations from runners (StepSecurity Harden-Runner, GitHub-native egress filtering).
