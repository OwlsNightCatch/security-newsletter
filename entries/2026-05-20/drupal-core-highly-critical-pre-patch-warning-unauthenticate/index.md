  title: Patch Drupal CVE-2026-9082 today on PostgreSQL-backed deployments
  action: >
    Active in-the-wild exploitation was confirmed by Drupal and corroborated by NCSC.ch on
    2026-05-22; Imperva reports observing 15,000+ exploitation attempts against ~6,000 sites across
    65 countries (Imperva, 2026-05-21). The flaw is an anonymous pre-authentication SQL injection in
    the Entity Query API's PostgreSQL path — no login, no role, no user interaction required. Swiss
    federal and cantonal portals, EU institution Drupal instances, and academic SWITCH-hosted sites
    running PostgreSQL backends are direct targets.

On 2026-05-18 the Drupal Security Team published [PSA-2026-05-18](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2026-05-18) reserving an emergency out-of-band release for today, 2026-05-20, 17:00–21:00 UTC. The pre-advisory scores the flaw 20/25 on Drupal's own published security scale — the second-highest tier — with **Access Complexity "None"** and **Authentication "None"**, meaning exploitation is unauthenticated and requires no special conditions; the chained score sits below the theoretical 25/25 only because the Drupal Security Team rates the affected configuration as "Uncommon". CVE assignment and class are embargoed until release. Affected branches: 10.5.x, 10.6.x, 11.2.x, 11.3.x receive official patches; Drupal also reserved manual emergency patch files for EOL branches 8.9, 9.5, 10.4 (→ 10.4.9) and 11.1 (→ 11.1.9) — an unusual step that itself signals severity. Drupal 7 is not affected. The Security Team explicitly notes ["exploits might be developed within hours or days"](https://www.securityweek.com/drupal-to-patch-highly-critical-vulnerability-at-risk-of-quick-exploitation/). NCSC.ch's Security Hub corroborates the urgency, reiterating that ["Successful exploitation could allow unauthenticated attackers to fully compromise affected Drupal installations"](https://security-hub.ncsc.admin.ch/#/posts/12584). BSI WID-SEC-2026-1579 carries the same advance warning ([BSI CERT-Bund](https://wid.cert-bund.de/portal/wid/securityadvisory?name=WID-SEC-2026-1579)).

**Why it matters to us:** Drupal is the dominant CMS for Swiss federal / cantonal / municipal portals, European Commission and EU-agency sites, universities, and public-sector NGOs. No technical mitigation exists pre-patch. Schedule the patch window now and monitor the [Drupal Security Advisories feed](https://www.drupal.org/security) for the CVE and patch links the moment they publish at 17:00 UTC.

## Update — 2026-05-21T05:00:07Z

Yesterday's brief carried Drupal's PSA pre-warning that a "highly critical" core advisory was scheduled for 2026-05-20; today the [SA-CORE-2026-004 advisory](https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2026-004) landed with **CVE-2026-9082** assigned — an anonymous SQL-injection in Drupal core's database abstraction API (CWE-89) rated **20/25 on Drupal's risk scale (Highly Critical)** that affects only PostgreSQL-backed installations. Specially-crafted HTTP requests slip past sanitisation in the core DB-API layer and inject arbitrary SQL with no authentication; successful exploitation leads to information disclosure, privilege escalation and — in some database configurations — RCE. The Drupal Security Team explicitly stated that "exploits might be developed within hours or days" of advisory release ([Drupal PSA, 2026-05-18](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2026-05-18)).

Affected versions: 8.9.0 through 10.4.10, 10.5.x < 10.5.10, 10.6.x < 10.6.9, 11.0.0 through 11.1.10, 11.2.x < 11.2.12, 11.3.x < 11.3.10. Patched: 10.4.10 / 10.5.10 / 10.6.9 / 11.1.10 / 11.2.12 / 11.3.10 (released 2026-05-20). MySQL / MariaDB / SQLite installations are not affected by this CVE. Drupal 7 is unaffected; sites on EOL Drupal 8/9 majors must apply manual patch files. [Drupal Steward WAF](https://www.drupal.org/steward) subscribers receive vendor-provided rules at advisory release per the service description; non-subscriber sites must apply the core update. NCSC-CH carried the advisory in its Security Hub ([NCSC-CH, 2026-05-19](https://security-hub.ncsc.admin.ch/#/posts/12584); [SecurityWeek, 2026-05-19](https://www.securityweek.com/drupal-to-patch-highly-critical-vulnerability-at-risk-of-quick-exploitation/); [CSO Online, 2026-05-20](https://www.csoonline.com/article/4175329/drupal-admins-rushing-to-patch-maximum-severity-sql-injection-vulnerability.html)).

**Defender takeaway:** detection — PostgreSQL slow-query logs and `pg_stat_activity` for abnormal SQL statements from the Drupal application user; web-server access logs for unusual URL-encoded SQL meta-characters in POST/GET parameters proxied through the Drupal DB-API layer; WAF rules targeting PostgreSQL-specific injection patterns (`UNION`, `CAST`, `pg_sleep`). Hardening — patch immediately on PostgreSQL backends; if patch deployment is blocked by change-control, temporarily front the site with the Drupal Steward WAF or apply a temporary WAF rule covering known SQL-injection vectors at the DB-API layer.

## Update — 2026-05-23T05:00:10Z

On 2026-05-22 Drupal updated [SA-CORE-2026-004](https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2026-004) to confirm that exploit attempts targeting CVE-2026-9082 — the anonymous pre-authentication SQL injection in the Entity Query API's PostgreSQL path — are now being detected in the wild. NCSC.ch updated [Security Hub post 12584](https://security-hub.ncsc.admin.ch/#/posts/12584) to "Actively exploited" status the same day at 13:52Z, also recording the addition of CVE-2026-9082 to the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog on 2026-05-22 (the NCSC-CH post is the brief's source of record on the KEV add; the CISA news-events alert URL constructed earlier in the day returned a 404 at composition time).

Imperva reports observing **15,000+ exploitation attempts against approximately 6,000 Drupal sites across 65 countries** within days of disclosure ([Imperva, 2026-05-21](https://www.imperva.com/blog/imperva-customers-protected-against-cve-2026-9082-in-drupal-core/)). The technical mechanism (now public via the [Searchlight Cyber write-up](https://slcyber.io/research-center/keys-to-the-kingdom-anonymous-sql-injection-in-drupal-core-cve-2026-9082/)): on the case-insensitive `IN` operator path through `core/lib/Drupal/Core/Entity/Query/Sql/Condition::compile()` / `ConditionAggregate::compile()`, a JSON-encoded array value survives into the SQL placeholder name without sanitisation, allowing injection when the backend is PostgreSQL. Fixed versions: 10.4.10, 10.5.10, 10.6.9, 11.1.10, 11.2.12 and 11.3.10; best-effort patches for EOL Drupal 8.9 and 9 are also available. MySQL/MariaDB/SQLite-backed Drupal sites remain unaffected, which is the temporary control to fall back on if the patch window slips past today.

Defender vantage update from yesterday's brief: the operational frame is no longer "patch when convenient" but **patch today** — the § 0 Immediate Action carries the operational framing; this UPDATE captures the source-of-record links and the technical mechanism for anyone composing internal advisories or hunt queries. CH/EU specifics: NCSC.ch Security Hub is the authoritative jurisdictional source for Swiss federal and cantonal operators; Drupal-on-PostgreSQL is widespread across FITKO and SWITCH-hosted university sites, French `gouvernement.fr` instances and EU institution portals. Detection: WAF telemetry for nested JSON arrays in user-supplied fields hitting Drupal endpoints; PostgreSQL `log_min_duration_statement` to surface anomalous query shapes; web-server logs for unexpected POST payloads to anonymous routes.
