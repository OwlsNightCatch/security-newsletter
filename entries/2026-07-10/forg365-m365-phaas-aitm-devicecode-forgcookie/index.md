title: "Forg365: a commercial Microsoft 365 phishing-as-a-service kit bundling device-code + AiTM phishing, in-panel AI lure drafting, and a browser extension for SSO-cookie persistence"
headline: "ZeroBEC details Forg365 — a Telegram-sold M365 PhaaS that survives MFA and keeps operator access alive via a ForgCookie browser extension"
summary: >
  ZeroBEC documented Forg365, a Telegram-distributed, subscription-priced Microsoft 365 phishing-as-a-service
  platform that pairs an OAuth device-code phishing path with an adversary-in-the-middle session-theft path,
  an in-panel AI lure generator, and a companion browser extension (ForgCookie) that silently refreshes the
  stolen Microsoft SSO cookie so access persists without the victim re-authenticating. Both paths yield a
  valid, MFA-satisfied token because the victim completes the real Microsoft login. It is a distinct kit and
  operator from the Railway/EvilTokens device-code campaign covered earlier — same primitive, productized.

ZeroBEC's teardown, corroborated by BleepingComputer and a CSA Labs research note, describes Forg365 as a Telegram-distributed, subscription-priced (5-day trial, $400/month, $3,800/year) Microsoft 365 phishing-as-a-service platform that packages two independent credential-theft paths behind one operator console ([ZeroBEC, 2026-07-09](https://zerobec.com/blog/inside-forg365-telegram-distributed-sneaky2fa-style-phaas); [BleepingComputer, 2026-07-09](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-forg365-phishing-platform-uses-ai-to-target-microsoft-365-accounts/)). The device-authorization branch presents a Microsoft-styled verification-code page and drives the legitimate Microsoft Authentication Broker flow; the adversary-in-the-middle branch classifies inbound traffic to decide whether to serve the phishing page or a benign decoy. Both converge on a valid, MFA-satisfied refresh token or session cookie because the victim completes the genuine Microsoft authentication — as CSA Labs puts it, "multifactor authentication does not stop the attack because the victim, not the attacker, is the one completing the MFA challenge" ([CSA Labs, 2026-07-10](https://labs.cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/csa-research-note-forg365-ai-phishing-service-20260710-csa-s/)). Two capabilities stand out beyond the already-covered device-code primitive: an AI lure-drafting assistant embedded directly in the panel alongside SMTP rotation, OAuth-app configuration and token vaulting, and ForgCookie — a Chrome/Edge/Brave extension that silently triggers OAuth flows to refresh the stolen SSO cookie so operator access outlives its normal expiry ([ZeroBEC, 2026-07-09](https://zerobec.com/blog/inside-forg365-telegram-distributed-sneaky2fa-style-phaas)). ZeroBEC's Entra telemetry tied observed device-code activity to a residential ISP address, with a campaign-linked backend node later performing Microsoft Graph device-registration calls.

**Defender takeaway:** the durable, kit-independent detections are in Entra sign-in and audit telemetry, not on the lure — surface device-code authentication events (device-code client-id patterns in sign-in logs), OAuth app consent grants and mailbox-rule changes clustered immediately after a sign-in, and browser-extension installs on managed endpoints that programmatically refresh SSO cookies. Forg365 is a distinct product and operator from the Railway/EvilTokens device-code campaign, so it is a new entry rather than an update; the shared abused primitive (device-authorization-grant phishing) is already covered and not re-taught here. **Triage:** legitimate device-code sign-ins are real (CLI tools, smart-TV and headless-device apps) — the discriminator is a verification-code prompt reached via an unsolicited email lure or phone call rather than a user-initiated CLI/device flow, and a subsequent refresh-token or cookie reuse from an origin, ASN or device posture that does not match the user's baseline. Because the token is MFA-satisfied, revocation (`revokeSignInSessions`), not a password reset, is what actually evicts the operator.
