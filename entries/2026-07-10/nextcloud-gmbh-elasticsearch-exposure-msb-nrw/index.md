headline: "Nextcloud GmbH exposed 367K internal records — client setup scripts with hardcoded DB credentials, a German ministry contact — via open Elasticsearch"
summary: >
  Cybernews found a publicly reachable, unauthenticated Elasticsearch cluster (~7.9 GB, ~367,000 records) belonging to Nextcloud GmbH's own corporate/hosting infrastructure — not the open-source Nextcloud software and no customer-operated servers. Exposed for roughly nine days in May 2026, it held invoices, contracts, internal/client email, and shell/Python client-setup scripts, some carrying hardcoded database credentials; named exposed parties include IONOS, STRATO and Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia Ministry of Schools and Education (MSB NRW). The risk to EU public-sector Nextcloud tenants is pretexting-grade material and a supplier-side secrets-hygiene lesson, not a confirmed downstream compromise.

  - "Audit your own Elasticsearch/OpenSearch estate: bind clusters to internal-only interfaces or a VPC, enable the security/auth plugin (it is off by default on TCP 9200/9300), and add continuous external attack-surface scanning for unauthenticated data/management ports."
  - "Treat hardcoded credentials in infrastructure-as-code and setup scripts as a secrets-management finding to remediate regardless of whether the script is ever exposed."

Cybernews researchers discovered a publicly reachable, unauthenticated Elasticsearch cluster — about 7.92 GB across ~367,000 records — belonging to Nextcloud GmbH's own hosting and business infrastructure, not the Nextcloud open-source collaboration software and not any customer-operated Nextcloud server ([Cybernews, 2026-07-08](https://cybernews.com/security/nextcloud-cloud-provider-data-leak/)). The cluster was reachable from at least 18 May until Nextcloud closed it around 25-27 May 2026. Exposed, and in many cases unencrypted, records included client invoices and contracts (naming partnership terms and contact email addresses), internal and client email with headers and timestamps, beta-feature signup lists, and — the most operationally significant category — shell and Python scripts Nextcloud built to set up and manage its product for clients, some containing hardcoded database credentials (`T1552.001`). Named exposed parties in the contact data include hosting providers IONOS and STRATO and German government bodies such as North Rhine-Westphalia's Ministry of Schools and Education (MSB NRW). Nextcloud confirmed the root cause as a hosting-infrastructure misconfiguration, said no customer-operated Nextcloud servers were affected, reported the incident to its German data-protection supervisory authority, and states it found no evidence the data was accessed before closure — though an internet-reachable, unauthenticated Elasticsearch index is precisely the target continuously swept by automated internet-wide scanning, so prior undetected access cannot be excluded ([heise online, 2026-07-09](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Open-database-Nextcloud-GmbH-fixes-potential-data-leak-11358446.html)).

The relevance for this constituency is the supplier context: Nextcloud is actively adopted as a "Euro-Office" sovereign-cloud alternative to Microsoft 365/SharePoint across EU public administration, so vendor-side exposure of client-specific onboarding scripts and hardcoded credentials is a supply-chain-adjacent risk to any public-sector tenant whose material was in the leak. **Defender takeaway:** the concrete, transferable actions are secrets hygiene (never hardcode credentials in IaC/setup scripts, even ones that never leave internal storage) and external attack-surface monitoring for unauthenticated data stores — Elasticsearch/OpenSearch defaults to no authentication on 9200/9300 unless the security plugin is explicitly enabled, and this exposure was purely a network-reachability misconfiguration no host-based control would have caught. For Nextcloud clients specifically, the near-term threat is not a patch but pretexting: the leaked invoices and contracts are realistic phishing fodder (`T1566`), so raise scrutiny on unsolicited invoice/contract emails referencing Nextcloud or its hosting-partner ecosystem.
