headline: "NCSC-CH flags a Zimbra Classic Web Client flaw where opening a crafted email runs script in the webmail session — patch to ZCS 10.1.19"
summary: >
  Zimbra patched a Classic Web Client security issue in ZCS 10.1.19 (2026-07-07) where a specially
  crafted email runs malicious code when opened, exposing mailbox contents, session data and account
  settings; heise describes it as stored cross-site scripting. Switzerland's NCSC-CH surfaced it in its
  own advisory on 2026-07-10 with exploitation status "unknown" and no CVE assigned. Only the legacy
  Classic Web Client is affected — the Modern Web Client is not. Public-sector and telecom Zimbra
  operators across Europe should identify Classic Web Client use and upgrade.

Zimbra released ZCS 10.1.19 on 2026-07-07 to fix a Classic Web Client issue in which "a specially crafted email could run malicious code when the email is opened," potentially granting access to mailbox information, session data or account settings ([Zimbra, 2026-07-07](https://blog.zimbra.com/2026/07/patch-release-update-zimbra-10-1-19/)); heise online covered it the same day as a stored cross-site-scripting flaw in the legacy webmail UI ([heise online, 2026-07-07](https://www.heise.de/news/Zimbra-Collaboration-Suite-Kritische-Luecke-macht-Classic-Web-Client-angreifbar-11356522.html)). Switzerland's NCSC-CH added the item to its Cyber Security Hub on 2026-07-10, describing it as allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to reach session data, account settings and mailbox contents when a victim opens a malicious email, and explicitly recording the exploitation status as unknown ([NCSC-CH / GovCERT.ch, 2026-07-10](https://security-hub.ncsc.admin.ch/#/posts/12757)). Only the Classic Web Client is affected; Zimbra and heise recommend switching users to the Modern Web Client as an interim mitigation.

**Defender takeaway:** the observable behavior is client-side script execution inside an authenticated webmail session triggered by message rendering — in webmail/application logs and browser telemetry, watch for anomalous outbound requests or session-token access originating from the webmail origin immediately after a message is opened, and for mailbox operations (rule creation, forwarding, bulk reads) that follow such a sequence. **Triage:** legitimate HTML mail renders inline content routinely, so a single rendered message is not the signal; the discriminator is script execution that reaches the session store or drives mailbox/account-setting changes rather than merely displaying content. The honest caveats are that no CVE has been assigned and no exploitation has been confirmed — the actionable reason to move now is that a national authority for the constituency chose to publish it and the affected surface is an unauthenticated, on-open path in a webmail platform still used across European public-sector and telecom environments.
