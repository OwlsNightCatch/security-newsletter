title: "GodDamn ransomware (Beast/Monster rebrand) blinds EDR with 'PoisonX', a malicious kernel driver Microsoft signed"
headline: "Symantec: a driver built malicious from the outset — yet WHCP-signed — defeats code-signing allowlisting to kill EDR before GodDamn encrypts"
summary: >
  Symantec attributes GodDamn ransomware (first seen 2026-05-21) to the Hyadina developer behind
  the Monster→Beast lineage, and documents a June 2026 intrusion where the operators loaded
  PoisonX (g11.sys) — a kernel driver they got signed under Microsoft's Windows Hardware
  Compatibility Publisher program despite it being malicious by design — to terminate security
  processes and strip user-mode API hooks before encrypting. The signed-malicious-driver twist
  means code-signing allowlisting will not stop it; detection must be behavioural.

Symantec's Threat Hunter Team assesses that GodDamn — surfaced as a "new" ransomware, first observed 2026-05-21 — is the latest rebrand in a lineage it tracks to a developer called Hyadina: Monster (2022) → Beast → GodDamn, the last sharing significant code overlap with Beast ([Symantec/Broadcom, 2026-07-09](https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/goddamn-ransomware-beast-rebrand)). The investigated early-June intrusion is a conventional human-operated ransomware kill chain with one standout component. AnyDesk appeared on the first host staged under the user's Music folder — a placement Symantec reads as manual attacker delivery, not a normal install — and began beaconing to relay infrastructure. The operators then dropped a defence-evasion binary masquerading as a Symantec product, which installed the PoisonX kernel driver (`g11.sys`) into the system driver store, staged a 14-tool credential-harvesting kit (13 NirSoft utilities plus Mimikatz) under the profile, moved laterally across 10-plus hosts via PsExec while re-installing AnyDesk on each for unattended access (writing `ad.security.interactive_access=2` to suppress the consent prompt and registering it as auto-start services), disabled Windows Defender real-time monitoring, and finally deployed the encrypter ([Symantec/Broadcom, 2026-07-09](https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/goddamn-ransomware-beast-rebrand); [The Hacker News, 2026-07-09](https://thehackernews.com/2026/07/goddamn-ransomware-uses-poisonx-driver.html)).

PoisonX is what distinguishes this case from routine bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver tradecraft. Rather than abusing a flaw in a legitimate signed driver, PoisonX is a driver built to be malicious that its developers nonetheless got signed under Microsoft's "Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher" program; once loaded it terminates security-product processes and strips user-mode API hooks, so it disables EDR visibility rather than merely evading it. It was first documented earlier in 2026 killing the CrowdStrike Falcon service via a crafted IOCTL to an undocumented driver interface ([Symantec/Broadcom, 2026-07-09](https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/goddamn-ransomware-beast-rebrand)). **Defender takeaway:** because the driver carries a valid Microsoft signature, code-signing allowlists and reputation checks pass it — detection has to be behavioural. **Triage:** legitimate driver installs do not co-occur with mass termination of security services, so the load of a rarely-seen driver immediately followed by security-product process/service stops and the loss of user-mode hooks on the same host is the discriminator; AnyDesk running from a personal media folder (versus IT-managed Program Files) and configured for unattended access is a second, independent pivot.
