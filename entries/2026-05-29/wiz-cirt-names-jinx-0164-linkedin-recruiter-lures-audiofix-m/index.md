Wiz CIRT [identified and named JINX-0164 on 2026-05-27](https://www.wiz.io/blog/threat-actors-target-crypto-orgs), a financially motivated cluster active since mid-2025 against cryptocurrency organisations. Initial access is LinkedIn-based social engineering — fake recruiter personas direct targets to fraudulent video-conferencing platforms that deliver **AUDIOFIX**, a compiled-Python macOS binary functioning as both infostealer and backdoor. AUDIOFIX harvests Keychain contents, Chrome / Firefox / Safari credentials, SSH keys, AWS / GCP / Azure cloud-provider credentials, and credentials from 51 cryptocurrency-wallet browser extensions; persistence is a `LaunchAgent` plist under `~/Library/LaunchAgents`. From the endpoint, JINX-0164 pivots into CI/CD infrastructure using stolen developer credentials and injects poisoned commits under legitimate developer identities; any team member building from the affected branches receives **MINIRAT**, a lightweight Go-based backdoor. The supply-chain escalation materialised through the `@velora-dex/sdk` npm package version 4.9.1 (trojanised 2026-04-07), which staged MINIRAT via LaunchCtl persistence. Wiz notes TTP overlap with prior DPRK-adjacent tradecraft (UNC1069, Sapphire Sleet) but stops short of formal attribution. The [Hacker News writeup](https://thehackernews.com/2026/05/jinx-0164-targets-cryptocurrency-firms.html) corroborates with additional MINIRAT detail. Mapped to T1566.003 (Spearphishing via Service: LinkedIn), T1543.001 (Launch Agent), T1555 (Credentials from Password Stores), T1195.002 (Compromise Software Supply Chain) and T1098.005 (Device Registration). For Swiss / EU SOCs the relevant exposure is *Crypto Valley* and any organisation whose developers build from npm dependencies that fan out to internal CI/CD — Sigstore signature verification, lock-file pinning of `@velora-dex/sdk`, and CI runner least-privilege are the operational asks.
