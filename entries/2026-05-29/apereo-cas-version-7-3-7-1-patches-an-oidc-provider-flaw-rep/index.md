The Apereo Foundation [released CAS version 7.3.7.1 on 2026-05-27](https://apereo.github.io/2026/05/27/oidc-vuln/) fixing an unspecified vulnerability in the OpenID Connect identity-provider component of its Central Authentication Service. Apereo scoped the disclosure to deployments where CAS acts as an OIDC IdP (no explicit statement about non-OIDC deployments, but the scoping suggests SAML / Kerberos-only configurations are out of scope of this specific defect). The reporters are **Artur Stoecklin and David Roth at Coop (Switzerland)**, who reported the issue to the Apereo team via the **YesWeHack** bug-bounty platform — a direct CH-discovered identity-infrastructure issue rather than a vendor-only disclosure. CERT-FR / ANSSI [issued advisory CERTFR-2026-AVI-0654 on 2026-05-28](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/avis/CERTFR-2026-AVI-0654/) framing the impact as *"un problème de sécurité non spécifié par l'éditeur"* and recommending immediate patching. Full technical details are withheld pending the standard security grace window. Apereo CAS is the dominant open-source SSO platform in European higher education and is also deployed across Swiss federal and cantonal administrations.

**Why it matters to us:** CH-relevant identity infrastructure with an EU-wide deployment footprint and a CH-sourced disclosure. Until technical detail is public, prioritise upgrade to the fixed version 7.3.7.1 on any CAS instance acting as an OIDC IdP and monitor OIDC token-issuance logs for unexpected `client_id` values, anomalous `sub` claims and tokens granted to unregistered clients.
