TechCrunch reported on 2026-05-27 that *ukvisaportal.com* — a third-party site marketed as an immigration portal but **not affiliated with the UK Government** — [exposed roughly 100,000 documents](https://techcrunch.com/2026/05/27/uk-visa-portal-spilled-thousands-of-applicants-passports-and-selfies-online-and-hasnt-fixed-the-leak/) via a misconfigured Amazon S3 bucket. The bucket was not publicly listed, but a backend bug exposed directory listing, enabling enumeration of every object; individual files were readable to anyone with the URL. Exposed material included full passport pages (passport number, nationality, DOB, place of birth, issue / expiry dates), accompanying address documents and selfie photographs whose **EXIF GPS metadata** could pinpoint the applicant's home address. The operator — UAE-registered *Active Leadgen LLC* — marketed under brand names including "UK Visit" and "ETA-Pass" and impersonated the official GOV.UK service; some applicants told TechCrunch they paid fees believing it was the genuine government portal. TechCrunch and [TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/uk-visa-portal-website-leaks-thousands-of-user-passport-data-and-photos-online) report the bucket was secured overnight after publication; no ICO breach notification has surfaced in-window.

**Defender takeaway:** the lookalike-government-service pattern matters operationally even outside immigration. Where the public-sector security team is responsible for citizen-facing brand integrity (federal / cantonal IT, KAPO digital-services teams), the relevant action is to scan for lookalike domains and S3 / blob buckets carrying passport / ID-document keys — Trufflehog-style scanning of cloud-storage namespaces for `passport`, `national-id`, `eta` filename patterns. EU residents who used the service trigger UK GDPR Art. 33 notification on the operator's side.
