WatchGuard's Secplicity team [published telemetry on 2026-05-26 covering a sustained 2026 Grandoreiro banking-trojan campaign](https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-security-hub/secplicity-blog/grandoreiro-malware-campaign-targets-europe-and-latin-america) against banks in Portugal and Spain (and across Latin America). The campaign deploys Delphi-11-compiled DLLs through DLL side-loading against four abused legitimate signed binaries; the Grandoreiro core has been re-tooled to use the `sgcWebSockets` library for command-and-control, with **STUN and ICE protocols enabling NAT traversal** — C2 traffic visually blends with web-conferencing data and bypasses standard protocol-inspection rules. WatchGuard names Abanca, Banco de Portugal, BBVA PT, Caixa Geral Depositos, Santander, Revolut and Wise as targeted institutions. A parallel Latin American mobile-banking strand: [ESET WeLiveSecurity documents BTMOB](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/malware/btmob-stealthy-rat-burrowing-deep-android-devices/), an Android RAT (evolved from SpySolr) sold malware-as-a-service, documented by ESET as targeting users in Brazil and Argentina. BTMOB requests Accessibility Service permissions and uses them for full device takeover — HTML-injected overlay phishing, keylogging and on-demand screen recording. [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2026/05/grandoreiro-malware-and-btmob-rat.html) provides a combined writeup with the WatchGuard / ESET coverage.
