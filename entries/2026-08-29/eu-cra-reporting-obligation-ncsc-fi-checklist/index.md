title: "Finland's NCSC-FI publishes an operational manufacturer checklist for the EU Cyber Resilience Act's 24h/72h/14-day/1-month reporting clock, two weeks before the 11 September 2026 go-live"
headline: "NCSC-FI supplies the CRA reporting deadlines the Commission's own guidance had left unstated"
summary: >
  Finland's national cybersecurity authority (NCSC-FI, part of Traficom) published a manufacturer checklist on
  2026-08-28 ahead of the EU Cyber Resilience Act's mandatory vulnerability/incident-reporting obligation, specifying
  the exact notification clock: a 24-hour early warning, a 72-hour supplemented notification, and a final report due
  14 days after a fix (for a vulnerability) or one month after notification (for a severe incident) — all submitted
  through ENISA's centralised Single Reporting Platform. That obligation is now in legal effect as of 2026-09-11.

  NCSC-FI is a national authority acting as primary discloser for its own jurisdiction's implementation guidance.
  ENISA's own SRP FAQ (updated 2026-08-31) now independently corroborates the 24h/72h/14-day/1-month notification
  clock itself, not only the platform's go-live date. The API-submission target of spring 2027 remains NCSC-FI's own
  claim, not independently confirmed by ENISA, whose FAQ states only that no API will be provided "at this stage"
  with no specific date. Credibility on the reporting-clock claim moves from 2 to 1 given this independent
  corroboration; the uncorroborated API-timeline claim keeps the entry at an overall credibility of 2. NCSC-FI's
  checklist and ENISA's FAQ disagree on the Assigned Representative cap (NCSC-FI: two named representatives; ENISA:
  one Primary plus up to 20 Secondary) — the entry surfaces both figures rather than silently picking one, per the
  fake-news/contradiction-handling policy. ENISA's SRP overview page is a continuously-updated hub rather than a
  dated article; its own sub-pages carry explicit "Updated: 9/10 September 2026" labels, which is why this entry
  cites it at 2026-09-10, even though the page's own extracted publication metadata is older.

      The reporting obligation this entry tracked ahead of go-live is now in legal effect: as of
      2026-09-11, CRA Article 14 mandatory reporting binds every in-scope manufacturer, including
      products already on the EU market before this date. Neither the European Commission's own

      today, only that this was ENISA's operational target — recorded as an open point rather than
      asserted.

The EU Cyber Resilience Act's reporting obligations bind from 11 September 2026, requiring manufacturers of
"products with digital elements" placed on the EU market to report actively exploited vulnerabilities and severe
incidents through ENISA's centralised Single Reporting Platform (SRP)
([NCSC-FI / Traficom, 2026-08-28](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/news/manufacturers-prepare-advance-reporting-vulnerabilities-and-incidents-under-cyber-resilience-act)).
On 2026-08-28, with two weeks left before the obligation binds, NCSC-FI published a manufacturer checklist
supplying the concrete notification clock: an early warning within 24 hours of the manufacturer becoming aware of an
actively exploited vulnerability or severe incident, supplemented within 72 hours; for a vulnerability, a final
report within 14 days after a corrective or mitigating measure becomes available; for a severe incident, a final
report within one month of the incident notification
([NCSC-FI / Traficom, 2026-08-28](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/news/manufacturers-prepare-advance-reporting-vulnerabilities-and-incidents-under-cyber-resilience-act)).
ENISA's own FAQ for the platform independently states the identical clock
([ENISA, 2026-08-31](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/product-security/single-reporting-platform-srp/frequently-asked-questions)).
The SRP itself is only "scheduled to be operational by 11 September 2026" — the same date the reporting duty starts
to apply — and, eight days before that go-live, ENISA's FAQ still gives no published platform URL, stating only that
it "will be communicated and published in due course"
([ENISA, 2026-08-31](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/product-security/single-reporting-platform-srp/frequently-asked-questions)).
NCSC-FI's checklist directs manufacturers to identify in-scope products now — noting that products past end-of-life
and no longer receiving updates remain subject to the reporting obligation — appoint an Assigned Representative (AR)
authorised to submit SRP notifications, document an internal report-intake and triage process, and rehearse it at
least once before the first reportable case
([NCSC-FI / Traficom, 2026-08-28](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/news/manufacturers-prepare-advance-reporting-vulnerabilities-and-incidents-under-cyber-resilience-act)).
ENISA's own FAQ states a manufacturer may register one Primary AR and up to 20 Secondary ARs, and that a
non-validated AR may still submit up to 20 notifications before validation becomes mandatory, so an organisation
does not have to wait for validation to complete before filing its first report under time pressure
([ENISA, 2026-08-31](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/product-security/single-reporting-platform-srp/frequently-asked-questions)).
NCSC-FI's own checklist instead describes notifications as submittable only through two named representatives, a
narrower figure than ENISA's; the two authorities have not been reconciled, and ENISA's FAQ is treated as the more
current statement of the platform's own rules
([NCSC-FI / Traficom, 2026-08-28](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/news/manufacturers-prepare-advance-reporting-vulnerabilities-and-incidents-under-cyber-resilience-act)).
API-based submission is not expected until spring 2027 per NCSC-FI, and ENISA's own FAQ confirms only that "no
Application Programming Interfaces will be provided at this stage," without independently stating a target date —
so any automated vulnerability-management or SBOM-correlation pipeline still has to terminate at a manual web-portal
boundary for every notification filed before that changes
([NCSC-FI / Traficom, 2026-08-28](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/news/manufacturers-prepare-advance-reporting-vulnerabilities-and-incidents-under-cyber-resilience-act);
[ENISA, 2026-08-31](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/product-security/single-reporting-platform-srp/frequently-asked-questions)).
The reporting duty is not limited to products launched after 11 September 2026: legal analysis of Article 69(3) CRA
confirms it applies from that date to every in-scope product already placed on the EU market
([Hogan Lovells Cadwalader, 2026-06-10](https://www.hlc.com/en/publications/eu-cyber-resilience-act-preparing-for-vulnerability-and-incident-reporting)),
and NCSC-FI's own checklist states products past end-of-life and no longer receiving updates remain subject to the
obligation regardless
([NCSC-FI / Traficom, 2026-08-28](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/news/manufacturers-prepare-advance-reporting-vulnerabilities-and-incidents-under-cyber-resilience-act)).

**Defender takeaway:** any organisation manufacturing or supplying products with digital elements into the EU market
— including Swiss suppliers exporting into it — should confirm now that a Primary Assigned Representative (and,
where useful, Secondary ARs) is registered or ready to register on the SRP, that the 24-hour/72-hour/14-day/1-month
clock is built into the organisation's own incident-response runbook as a manual, portal-only filing step, and that
the process has been rehearsed at least once before 11 September 2026 — including for legacy products past
end-of-life, which remain subject to the obligation.

## Update — 2026-09-03T05:06:30Z

ENISA's own Single Reporting Platform FAQ, updated 31 August 2026, now independently states the same 24-hour/
72-hour/14-day/1-month notification clock this entry previously sourced to NCSC-FI alone
([ENISA, 2026-08-31](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/product-security/single-reporting-platform-srp/frequently-asked-questions)).
The Assigned Representative cap this entry previously described as "two" is corrected: ENISA's FAQ states a
manufacturer may register exactly one Primary AR and up to 20 Secondary ARs, and that a non-validated AR can submit
up to 20 notifications before validation becomes mandatory
([ENISA, 2026-08-31](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/product-security/single-reporting-platform-srp/frequently-asked-questions)).
Eight days before the 11 September go-live, the platform still has no published URL and the FAQ confirms no API will
exist at launch, without stating a specific date for one — the spring-2027 API target remains NCSC-FI's own claim,
not independently corroborated
([ENISA, 2026-08-31](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/product-security/single-reporting-platform-srp/frequently-asked-questions)).
Legal analysis of Article 69(3) CRA confirms the reporting duty applies from 11 September 2026 to every in-scope
product already on the EU market
([Hogan Lovells Cadwalader, 2026-06-10](https://www.hlc.com/en/publications/eu-cyber-resilience-act-preparing-for-vulnerability-and-incident-reporting)),
consistent with NCSC-FI's own checklist, which states products past end-of-life and no longer receiving updates
remain subject to the obligation regardless
([NCSC-FI / Traficom, 2026-08-28](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/news/manufacturers-prepare-advance-reporting-vulnerabilities-and-incidents-under-cyber-resilience-act)).
The SRP will be available in English only at launch
([ENISA — Single Reporting Platform (SRP) FAQ, 2026-08-31](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/product-security/single-reporting-platform-srp/frequently-asked-questions)).

## Update — 2026-09-11T04:40:00Z

The obligation this entry has tracked ahead of go-live is now in legal effect: the European Commission's own page states plainly, "as of 11 September 2026, manufacturers are required to report actively exploited vulnerabilities and severe incidents impacting the security of products with digital elements"
([European Commission, 2026-07-31](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cra-reporting)).
This covers every in-scope product already placed on the EU market before today, not only new ones, consistent with Article 69(3) CRA as this entry already recorded. Neither the Commission's page nor ENISA's own SRP page states that the platform is confirmed live and accepting submissions today — the Commission's page says only that "the Single Reporting Platform will be operational by 11 September 2026 (date of entry into application of the CRA reporting requirements)" and that "functional and security testing are under way"
([European Commission, 2026-07-31](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cra-reporting)),
while ENISA's own SRP page states that "from 11 September 2026, manufacturers are required to submit these mandatory notifications through the SRP" without an explicit operational-status confirmation
([ENISA, 2026-09-10](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/product-security/single-reporting-platform-srp)).
This entry therefore scopes its claim to what is independently confirmed — the legal reporting obligation is in effect — rather than to platform operational status, which no source reached has confirmed either way as of today.
