title: "CVE-2026-82078 / CVE-2026-81578 — PaperCut NG/MF: an Apache Tapestry request-routing confusion chains an unauthenticated config rewrite to arbitrary code execution, exploited before a patch existed"
headline: "PaperCut ships an emergency patch for a pre-auth RCE chain already used against live customers — and a second emergency release after the first one was bypassed"
summary: >
  PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF (all versions) carry an unauthenticated remote-code-execution chain — CVE-2026-81578
  (auth bypass, CVSS4.0 8.8) and CVE-2026-82078 (unsafe dynamic class loading, CVSS4.0 9.4) — that PaperCut confirmed
  under active exploitation on 2026-08-27, before any CVE or patch existed. Emergency Patch Release 3 (1 September
  2026) supersedes Release 2, fixes two regressions Release 2 introduced, and is now the only recommended fix; there
  is no fix for v23 and earlier, and Huntress estimates 47% of the PaperCut installs it tracks run v23 or older.
  GreyNoise now documents an AI-agent-orchestrated mass-exploitation campaign against this same chain, compromising
  440 instances across 395 organizations since 31 August 2026, reaching full domain admin in as little as five
  minutes via legacy Active Directory escalation paths.

  title: "Patch PaperCut NG/MF to Emergency Patch Release 3 now, or take internet-facing servers offline"
  action: >
    PaperCut NG and MF are under active exploitation via an unauthenticated request-routing chain that reaches
    remote code execution as the PaperCut server process; PaperCut now confirms a second, more sophisticated wave
    of attacks against servers that remain unpatched and internet-facing. Apply PaperCut's Emergency Patch Release 3
    immediately on every v24/25/26 Application Server and Site Server — Release 3 supersedes both the original
    emergency patch and Release 2, and fixes two regressions Release 2 itself introduced. For v23 and earlier there
    is no fix at all: restrict the Application Server to trusted/internal IP addresses right now, and treat any
    internet-facing instance as potentially compromised until proven otherwise.

  PaperCut's own bulletin confirms the vulnerability's existence, active exploitation and the two-CVE structure, but
  the deep technical narrative — the Apache Tapestry request-routing confusion mechanism, the specific HTTP request
  chains, the JDBC/Derby/Nashorn exploitation path, and the Huntress incident-response artifacts — traces to Rapid7
  and Huntress, both rated B (original vendor vuln/incident research) in sources.json rather than A. Reliability held
  at B rather than A to reflect that dependency, the same standard applied elsewhere to vendor advisories that lean

PaperCut has been hit before at this scale: in 2023, CVE-2023-27350 — an unrelated authentication-bypass flaw in the
same PaperCut NG/MF Application Server — was mass-exploited in the wild by multiple ransomware operators before a
patch existed, a precedent Rapid7's own incident-response team cites directly when framing why this new chain
demands the same urgency ([Rapid7, 2026-08-28](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/etr-papercut-ng-mf-critical-zero-day-exploited-in-the-wild/)).
Three years later, PaperCut disclosed on 27 August 2026 that it was investigating active exploitation of a new,
unrelated flaw in the same product line — again before any CVE, patch, or public technical detail existed, and
again reconstructed from a real victim's own incident-response evidence: a university customer's security and DFIR
team supplied the reproduction data that let PaperCut confirm and patch the bug
([PaperCut Software, 2026-08-29](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/security-bulletin-27-aug-2026-urgent-security-advisory/)).

PaperCut's Application Server runs on the Apache Tapestry web framework, whose "complex direct" request format lets
a single HTTP request name one page to render and a different page's component to actually execute. PaperCut's own
authorization check validates only the page selected for rendering, not the component that runs behind it — so a
request that asks Tapestry to render the public, unauthenticated Error, Exception, or Home page while invoking the
administrative `ConfigEditor` or `UserList` component bypasses authentication entirely
([Rapid7, 2026-08-28](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/etr-papercut-ng-mf-critical-zero-day-exploited-in-the-wild/)).
Through three such POST requests — `/app?service=direct/1/Error/ConfigEditor/quickFindForm`,
`.../ConfigEditor/$Form`, and `.../UserList/$QuickFind.$Form` — an unauthenticated attacker rewrites four external
card/ID lookup settings (`user-lookup.db-driver`, `user-lookup.db-url`, `user-lookup.id-to-username-sql`,
`user-lookup.enabled`) that normally point PaperCut at an administrator-configured external card database
([Rapid7, 2026-08-28](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/etr-papercut-ng-mf-critical-zero-day-exploited-in-the-wild/)).
Redirected instead to an attacker-controlled JDBC target through PaperCut's bundled Apache Derby driver and its
`foreignViews` feature, the connection reaches an attacker-controlled H2 database whose inline `INIT` statement
creates a JavaScript-backed trigger; PaperCut's bundled Nashorn JavaScript engine then executes that trigger to
launch an operating-system process — full remote code execution as the PaperCut server, triggered the moment the
forged `UserList` search runs the malicious lookup
([Rapid7, 2026-08-28](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/etr-papercut-ng-mf-critical-zero-day-exploited-in-the-wild/)).
This is a two-CVE chain: CVE-2026-81578 (CWE-306, missing authentication) is the pre-auth entry that gains write
access to the server configuration; CVE-2026-82078 (CWE-470, unsafe dynamic class loading) is the flaw that turns a
reconfigured database connection into arbitrary Java bytecode execution once that write access is held
([PaperCut Software, 2026-08-29](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/security-bulletin-27-aug-2026-urgent-security-advisory/)).

PaperCut treats **all versions** of NG and MF as potentially affected. Huntress observed two live customer
exploitations: one on 26 August lasting under two minutes against version 25.0.10.75465, and a second on 27 August
against version 24.1.5.71847 — before Emergency Patch Release 2 extended coverage to the v24 line
([Huntress, 2026-08-28](https://www.huntress.com/blog/papercut-actively-exploited)). In both cases the attacker ran
base64-encoded discovery commands (`whoami & ver`, and separately `whoami & ver & tasklist`) via a dropped,
OS-agnostic Java `.class` file that wrote its output to a temporary file and then deleted both that file and the
server's own `server.log`
([Huntress, 2026-08-28](https://www.huntress.com/blog/papercut-actively-exploited)). Huntress's own proof-of-concept
reproduced the full chain against a stock PaperCut NG install and observed the code execution surface as an
observable `charmap.exe` process running as SYSTEM, spawned under the PaperCut Application Server's own `pc-app.exe`
process
([Huntress, 2026-08-28](https://www.huntress.com/blog/papercut-actively-exploited)). PaperCut released an initial
emergency patch for v25/v26 on 28 August, which a Home-page variant of the same request bypassed
([Rapid7, 2026-08-28](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/etr-papercut-ng-mf-critical-zero-day-exploited-in-the-wild/)).
Emergency Patch Release 2, published later the same day with hardening developed alongside Huntress and watchTowr,
closed that bypass and extended coverage to v24, and was itself superseded on 1 September 2026 by Emergency Patch
Release 3 (see Update below)
([PaperCut Software, 2026-08-29](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/security-bulletin-27-aug-2026-urgent-security-advisory/)).
There is no fix for v23 and earlier — PaperCut's guidance for that line is to upgrade to a supported version — and
Huntress estimates 47% of the roughly 2,500 PaperCut installations it tracks still run v23 or older
([Huntress, 2026-08-28](https://www.huntress.com/blog/papercut-actively-exploited)).

Detection, telemetry class first: alert on any child process spawned from `pc-app.exe` or the PaperCut Application
Server's Java process — PaperCut never legitimately spawns a shell, `cmd.exe`, or a system-discovery utility such as
`charmap.exe`, `whoami`, or `tasklist` from that lineage. Web-access logs for the PaperCut Application Server should
be checked for POST requests to `/app?service=direct/*/{Error,Exception,Home}/ConfigEditor/*` or
`.../UserList/$QuickFind.$Form` from unauthenticated or external sources — this URL shape is not a pattern ordinary
PaperCut administration produces. Two log artifacts are near-unique indicators: a `server.log` line reading
`DB URL: jdbc:derby:memory:pwn`, and a corresponding `derby.log` entry recording Derby booting an in-memory database
directory whose name ends in the literal string `pwn`
([Huntress, 2026-08-28](https://www.huntress.com/blog/papercut-actively-exploited)). Both PaperCut and Huntress
stress that these artifacts' *absence* does not clear a system, since the observed payloads delete their own
`server.log` evidence after running
([PaperCut Software, 2026-08-29](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/security-bulletin-27-aug-2026-urgent-security-advisory/)).
**Triage:** an unexpectedly truncated, gapped, or missing `server.log` on a PaperCut Application Server is not
normal application behavior — legitimate log rotation does not delete mid-file — and is itself a high-confidence
signal worth investigating even where no other artifact survives. **Defender takeaway:** any PaperCut NG/MF
Application Server that has ever been reachable from the public internet should be assumed targeted; patch to
Emergency Patch Release 3 immediately, and where v23 or earlier cannot yet be replaced, remove public exposure
entirely rather than relying on detection alone.

## Update — 2026-09-03T05:05:00Z

PaperCut's Emergency Patch Release 3, published 1 September 2026, supersedes Release 2 and is cumulative — customers
do not need to install the earlier releases first
([PaperCut Software, 2026-09-02](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/security-bulletin-27-aug-2026-urgent-security-advisory/)).
Release 3 fixes two regressions Release 2 had itself introduced — broken SAML login flows, and lost support for
legacy Microsoft SQL Server drivers used for external card lookup — and adds further, undisclosed hardening against
the exploitation chain
([PaperCut Software, 2026-09-02](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/security-bulletin-27-aug-2026-urgent-security-advisory/)).
PaperCut also confirms a second wave of attacks against servers that remain unpatched and internet-facing, involving
"more sophisticated post-compromise behaviour" than what was observed in the first days of the incident
([PaperCut Software, 2026-09-02](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/security-bulletin-27-aug-2026-urgent-security-advisory/)).
The vendor's own incident data, published 30 August as additional indicators of compromise, names a concrete
follow-on chain from the original intrusion: after initial discovery commands, a PowerShell-delivered download
installs a Windows service literally named "Remote Access Service" running SimpleService.exe — a SimpleHelp
remote-access agent — as LocalSystem with auto-start, followed by a further download of AnyDesk; the bulletin does
not state whether this specific chain recurred in the second wave or belongs only to the earlier intrusions it was
published alongside
([PaperCut Software, 2026-09-02](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/security-bulletin-27-aug-2026-urgent-security-advisory/)).
Mobility Print and Print Deploy server components are unaffected; Site Servers and secondary/print servers do need
the same update as the primary Application Server
([PaperCut Software, 2026-09-02](https://www.papercut.com/kb/Main/security-bulletin-27-aug-2026-urgent-security-advisory/)).

## Update — 2026-09-10T05:00:00Z

GreyNoise's Global Observation Grid documents an AI-agent-orchestrated exploitation campaign against this chain
beginning 31 August 2026, run by a likely Russian-speaking operator already tracked since July 2026 for attacks on
Palo Alto, Ubiquiti, Citrix, SonicWall and Proxmox VE targets
([GreyNoise, 2026-09-09](https://www.greynoise.io/blog/ai-orchestrated-campaign-against-papercut-ng-mf)). The
operator built and tested both CVEs' exploits in a self-hosted PaperCut/Active Directory lab, sourced target lists
via the Netlas.io scanning service, then deployed hundreds of AI agents — built on OpenAI's Codex harness paired
with a DeepSeek model — to opportunistically "compromise at least 440 instances of PaperCut MF/NG hosted by 395
identified victim organizations in 48 countries"
([GreyNoise, 2026-09-09](https://www.greynoise.io/blog/ai-orchestrated-campaign-against-papercut-ng-mf)). GreyNoise
reports the adversary "went from an empty workspace to first achieving RCE against a real victim in just under
four hours, first domain admin in an additional two hours, and once the full campaign launched, compromised at
least 11 organizations in 26 seconds"
([GreyNoise, 2026-09-09](https://www.greynoise.io/blog/ai-orchestrated-campaign-against-papercut-ng-mf)), with one
US high school reaching full domain admin in seven minutes from initial access. Domain admin was ultimately reached
against only twelve of the 395 compromised organizations — "GreyNoise observed the adversary achieved domain admin
against only 12 victim organizations"
([GreyNoise, 2026-09-09](https://www.greynoise.io/blog/ai-orchestrated-campaign-against-papercut-ng-mf)) — via three
paths: LSASS credential harvesting for pass-the-hash against the domain controller when the PaperCut host was
domain-joined; the 2021 noPac flaws (CVE-2021-42278/CVE-2021-42287) where those remained unpatched; or directly
adding a new account to Domain Admins when the PaperCut host itself ran on the domain controller or under a
domain-admin service account. All three paths finished with a DCSync-based full NTDS.DIT credential dump; Cloudflare's
WAF defeated the adversary against at least one targeted instance. This delta is reported by GreyNoise alone; a
second independent source had not corroborated it as of this update.
