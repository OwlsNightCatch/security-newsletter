title: "Citizen Lab: a European Parliament spyware-inquiry member was himself infected twice with Pegasus"
headline: "Citizen Lab confirms Pegasus infected a PEGA-Committee MEP via the PWNYOURHOME zero-click chain"
summary: "Citizen Lab forensically confirmed that the iPhone of former MEP Stelios Kouloglou — a member of the European Parliament's PEGA committee investigating commercial-spyware abuse — was infected with NSO Group's Pegasus twice while he served on that committee (Oct 2022 via the PWNYOURHOME zero-click HomeKit→BlastDoor chain, and Mar 2023). The infections are unattributed but overlap a Pegasus operator also targeting Russian/Belarusian-speaking exiles in Europe. For SOCs protecting officials and oversight staff, the actionable surface is proactive mobile forensic triage and enforced device hardening, not endpoint alerting — the chain is zero-click."

Citizen Lab published a forensic report confirming, with high confidence, that the iPhone of Stelios Kouloglou — a former MEP who sat on the European Parliament's PEGA committee, the inquiry into commercial-spyware abuse — was infected with NSO Group's Pegasus on two occasions, around 21 October 2022 and 6–7 March 2023, while the device ran iOS 15.5 ([Citizen Lab, 2026-07-03](https://citizenlab.ca/research/member-of-committee-investigating-spyware-hacked-with-pegasus/)). The 2022 infection used the PWNYOURHOME zero-click chain: a specially crafted `NSKeyedArchive` object landing in the HomeKit daemon, followed by malicious content processed by `MessagesBlastDoorService` (iMessage's sandboxed attachment parser) — a distinct path from earlier NSO chains that abused iMessage directly. Citizen Lab does not attribute the intrusion to any government and explicitly found no indication of Greek-government responsibility, but notes the targeting infrastructure overlaps a previously documented Pegasus campaign against Russian- and Belarusian-speaking exiled journalists and opposition figures in Europe, suggesting a single Pegasus customer with multi-country authorization ([The Record, 2026-07-03](https://therecord.media/pegasus-spyware-european-parliament-pega-committee-member)). Because Kouloglou sat on the committee scrutinising exactly this abuse, the operator would have gained visibility into confidential PEGA deliberations — an EU parliamentary-privilege and confidentiality concern. **Defender takeaway:** PWNYOURHOME is zero-click, so there is no user action or phishing artefact to detect at the endpoint; the realistic defensive surface for parliamentarians, diplomats, and inquiry staff is proactive forensic triage (MVT against iOS sysdiagnose/backups) plus mandated Lockdown Mode / hardened MDM configuration that strips HomeKit and rich-content parsing from official devices. This continues a 2026 pattern of Citizen Lab naming EU institutional targets of mercenary spyware, alongside its earlier Cellebrite/Pivovarov forensic work.
