Student-loan servicer Navient Corporation (Nasdaq: NAVI) filed a Form 8-K (Item 1.05) on 2026-07-02 disclosing a material incident that did not touch its own systems: on 2026-06-08 it learned a third-party law firm providing services to the company had suffered a ransomware attack against the firm's own systems, and that Company-related borrower data held by the firm — names, dates of birth, addresses and Social Security numbers — was accessed ([SEC 8-K, 2026-07-02](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1593538/000114036126027441/ef20077249_8k.htm)). Navient found no evidence of access to its own environment and no operational disruption but determined materiality on 2026-06-29 given the volume and sensitivity of the exposed data. No ransomware group is named and no leak-site posting has surfaced; this is the victim's own regulatory disclosure of a fourth-party compromise, and no independent press coverage of the filing was found in-window (single-source.

**Defender takeaway:** the failure surface here is entirely upstream at the vendor. Litigation and collections files are a known high-value ransomware target (bulk PII with minimal relative security investment) — contracts with outside counsel and collections firms that hold SSN-class identifiers (AHV-number-class equivalents) should mandate encryption-at-rest, short breach-notification SLAs, and independent security assessment.
