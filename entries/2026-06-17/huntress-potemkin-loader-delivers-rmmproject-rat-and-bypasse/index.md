Huntress documented a ClickFix chain delivering a previously undocumented x64 loader named Potemkin (active since at least February 2026): a ClickFix lure installs an MSI that drops Potemkin via an HTA payload; the loader uses a domain-generation algorithm for C2 and reflectively loads follow-on modules in memory ([Huntress, 2026-06-16](https://www.huntress.com/blog/potemkin-loader-rmmproject-clickfix-attack)). Its payloads are EtherRAT (Node.js RAT with blockchain C2) and RMMProject, a Lua-scriptable DLL providing hidden remote desktop, keylogging and browser credential theft — including a module specifically built to defeat Chromium's App-Bound Encryption (the credential-storage protection added in Chrome 127) ([The Hacker News, 2026-06-16](https://thehackernews.com/2026/06/clickfix-campaigns-expand-malware.html)). Huntress observed lateral movement across 11+ hosts in one intrusion, indicating network-wide credential harvesting rather than single-host compromise.

**Why it matters to us:** The ABE bypass means saved Chrome credentials are again at risk on infected hosts. Hunt for `mshta.exe` spawned by `msiexec.exe`/`cmd.exe`, reflective-load memory anomalies, DGA-style DNS from `mshta.exe` children, and non-browser processes calling Chrome's DPAPI/LocalState decryption. Block `mshta.exe` via AppLocker/WDAC where feasible.
