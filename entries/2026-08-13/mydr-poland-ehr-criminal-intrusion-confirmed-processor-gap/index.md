  A Polish health-records processor confirms an intrusion, and because it is not the data
  controller it cannot tell the affected people
summary: >
  MyDr, one of Poland's largest electronic medical record providers, confirmed on 2026-08-12 that
  it was the target of a deliberate external criminal act affecting part of its data, saying the
  data is likely historical (2024 and earlier) and that it cannot yet state what was taken.
  Attackers who approached Polish outlet Zaufana Trzecia Strona claim 18,814,422 unique PESEL
  national identity numbers and 2.5 TB of data, and describe an access chain the outlet could not
  independently verify: remote code execution through an XXE flaw in PKCS#12 certificate handling,
  a GitHub API key, source code, then AWS. The transferable finding is structural: MyDr is a GDPR
  processor and the controllers are thousands of individual healthcare facilities, so affected
  individuals cannot be notified centrally and must wait for their own clinic.

  Two independent primaries: MyDr's own statement for what the company confirms, and Zaufana
  Trzecia Strona for the attackers' claims and the outlet's own verification work. The scale
  figures, the 2.5 TB volume and the entire access chain are the attackers' account relayed by the
  outlet, which states explicitly that it could not independently verify them; they are attributed
  as claims throughout and never as fact. The outlet's partial verification — matching records for
  three of five volunteered identity numbers, and a correct date of birth, identity number and
  phone number for a named politician — supports plausibility of scope, not the total. Source

MyDr serves thousands of Polish healthcare facilities and, on figures the company itself gives, processes three million appointments and 2.7 million prescriptions a month ([Zaufana Trzecia Strona, 2026-08-10](https://zaufanatrzeciastrona.pl/post/hakerzy-twierdza-ze-ukradli-dane-ponad-18-milionow-polek-i-polakow-z-firmy-mydr/)). It published an incident statement updated 2026-08-12 at 18:35 CET confirming an intrusion: "Na tym etapie trwającego dochodzenia potwierdzamy, że staliśmy się celem zewnętrznego, celowego działania o charakterze przestępczym, którym objęta była część danych" — at this stage of the ongoing investigation we confirm that we became the target of an external, deliberate act of a criminal nature, which covered part of the data ([MyDr, 2026-08-12](https://pro.mydr.pl/portal-info)). The company states the affected data is most likely historical, from 2024 and earlier, and may not cover all MyDr clients or all their patients; that its systems are fully operational and safe to use; that its cybersecurity partners monitoring the dark web have found no evidence the data has been published or shared publicly; and that it cannot yet confirm the quantity and type of data disclosed until forensic analysis completes ([MyDr, 2026-08-12](https://pro.mydr.pl/portal-info)).

The claims that prompted the statement are considerably larger. People presenting themselves as the perpetrators contacted Polish security journalist Adam Haertle before the disclosure and said they hold 18,814,422 unique PESEL national identity numbers and 2.5 TB of data ([Zaufana Trzecia Strona, 2026-08-10](https://zaufanatrzeciastrona.pl/post/hakerzy-twierdza-ze-ukradli-dane-ponad-18-milionow-polek-i-polakow-z-firmy-mydr/)). The outlet's verification is careful and worth reading as a method rather than a verdict: it was sent a database record for a senior Polish politician whose date of birth, identity number, name and one of two phone numbers it independently confirmed, along with the correct national health-fund region; it asked the claimants to look up the identity numbers of four industry volunteers and received records for two, which with the author's own record makes three matches out of five checked. The outlet states it caught the claimants in no inconsistency within what it could check, while being explicit that its checking ability is limited and that it has no way to verify either the 2.5 TB volume or the 18-million figure — though it observes that the figure is consistent with the potential reach of a system serving thousands of practices. It also records that Gawkowski, whom it names as premier, wrote publicly that much suggests an unauthorised person may have gained access to the data.

**The access chain is a lead, not a finding.** Per the claimants' own account, they first obtained remote code execution through an XXE-class flaw in the handling of PKCS#12 certificates — "Według tego, co usłyszeliśmy od sprawców, najpierw udało im się uzyskać zdalne wykonanie kodu przez podatność typu XXE przy obsłudze certyfikatów PKCS#12" — which yielded a GitHub API key, from there the platform's source code, and from there the AWS infrastructure. The outlet's next sentence is the one that governs how this should be read: "Nie byliśmy w stanie niezależnie zweryfikować tych informacji" — we were not able to independently verify this information ([Zaufana Trzecia Strona, 2026-08-10](https://zaufanatrzeciastrona.pl/post/hakerzy-twierdza-ze-ukradli-dane-ponad-18-milionow-polek-i-polakow-z-firmy-mydr/)). MyDr says it cannot share technical details while the investigation runs. No CVE exists and no vendor has confirmed a vulnerability class; treat the chain as an unverified attacker narrative that is nonetheless a reasonable thing to check for in your own certificate-parsing paths.

The extortion mechanics are documented more solidly, because the outlet handled the artefacts. The claimants sent the company's chief executive a message on 5 August linking to a PDF that was supposed to self-delete after download and did not; the file was password-protected, and the claimants noted the password was the executive's own PESEL number — which the outlet points out is a low-entropy value and therefore no obstacle. The document framed the approach as an offer to purchase the results of a security audit, and contained internal corporate correspondence including personnel information and a whistleblower report, alongside a fragment of the company's partner-doctor database. The claimants also showed a message sent to company employees from the company's own bulk-SMS account, and named Jira and a HubSpot CRM among systems they say they reached in full ([Zaufana Trzecia Strona, 2026-08-10](https://zaufanatrzeciastrona.pl/post/hakerzy-twierdza-ze-ukradli-dane-ponad-18-milionow-polek-i-polakow-z-firmy-mydr/)). On attribution the outlet is deliberately unhelpful in the right way: the claimants write in English, use a Russian-style emoticon convention, and produce English that reads as though deliberately rewritten to imitate a non-native speaker from elsewhere — which it reads as an attempt to lay false trails.

**The structural finding, and the reason this matters beyond Poland.** MyDr cannot tell affected people they are affected. "MyDr jest jedynie "podmiotem przetwarzającym" zgodnie z RODO, a administratorem danych są placówki ochrony zdrowia, których są tysiące" — MyDr is only a processor under GDPR, and the controllers are the healthcare facilities, of which there are thousands ([Zaufana Trzecia Strona, 2026-08-10](https://zaufanatrzeciastrona.pl/post/hakerzy-twierdza-ze-ukradli-dane-ponad-18-milionow-polek-i-polakow-z-firmy-mydr/)). The outlet's assessment is that individuals therefore have no way to check their own exposure and must wait for MyDr to determine scope, notify each facility, and for each facility to notify its own patients — a chain it expects to take many days. MyDr's own statement is consistent with this: it says it will contact affected clients proactively once it establishes which facilities and which data are involved, will support them in reporting to the data-protection authorities and in patient communication, and that no reports from facilities are required at present.

**Defender takeaway:** the operational lesson here is not a vulnerability, it is a notification topology, and every organisation that buys a shared sector platform inherits it. When the platform is the processor and each customer is the controller, the platform is legally the only party that knows the scope and legally not the party that can tell the affected people — so the elapsed time between "the processor knows" and "our people are told" is set by how fast the processor reaches *us*, and how prepared we are to act on what it sends. For a Swiss or European public-sector body running a shared health, education or administrative platform, the question worth answering before an incident is which side of that line each supplier sits on, and what the contractual clock is for the supplier to notify the controller — because the incident response you can actually run starts when that message arrives, not when the intrusion happens.

## Update — 2026-08-15T05:02:00Z

The earlier entry recorded MyDr's own confirmation of a deliberate external criminal act, its statement that it could not yet say what was taken, and the structural observation — made at the time by the reporting outlet rather than by any authority — that because MyDr is a processor and the controllers are thousands of individual healthcare facilities, affected people could not be notified centrally. Both halves have now been settled by the Polish state.

At a press briefing following a meeting of the Joint Cybersecurity Operations Centre, Deputy Prime Minister and digital affairs minister Krzysztof Gawkowski said the leak may cover nearly 19 million people and that the stolen database exceeds 2 TB ([Gazeta Prawna, 2026-08-13](https://www.gazetaprawna.pl/prawnik/artykuly/11289449,uodo-reaguje-na-gigantyczny-wyciek-danych-wazny-apel-do-polakow.html)), and characterised it as "one of the largest incidents in Poland's history" ([Notes from Poland, 2026-08-13](https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/08/13/poland-hit-by-theft-of-19-million-patients-data-from-medical-platform/)). That replaces MyDr's hedged position with a government-stated figure. Gawkowski also said there is no indication of an attack from Russia or another state and that cybercriminals are "very likely" responsible — a notable framing for a country whose public sector is regularly targeted by state-linked actors, and one that shapes what kind of follow-on activity defenders should expect. Around 12,000 medical facilities use MyDr's services, per the digital affairs ministry ([Notes from Poland, 2026-08-13](https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/08/13/poland-hit-by-theft-of-19-million-patients-data-from-medical-platform/)). MyDr said in a Wednesday update that at the time of writing there was no evidence the data had been published anywhere.

The regulator has now put the notification structure in writing. Poland's data protection authority UODO stated that the obligation to notify people affected by the leak rests with the controllers that used MyDr's services, and reminded controllers that under GDPR a breach must be reported to the supervisory authority without undue delay and where feasible no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it, with a reasoned explanation attached to any later report ([Gazeta Prawna, 2026-08-13](https://www.gazetaprawna.pl/prawnik/artykuly/11289449,uodo-reaguje-na-gigantyczny-wyciek-danych-wazny-apel-do-polakow.html)). UODO's advice to individuals is to lock their PESEL national identity number and to treat incoming SMS and email with more care to avoid phishing aimed at extracting further data or access to banking. Gawkowski separately urged people to use state services to check exposure and to lock their PESEL through the mObywatel portal ([Notes from Poland, 2026-08-13](https://notesfrompoland.com/2026/08/13/poland-hit-by-theft-of-19-million-patients-data-from-medical-platform/)).

**Defender takeaway:** the delta is a planning fact for any organisation that is a *processor* in a health or public-service supply chain. A breach at the processor triggers a 72-hour clock at every controller downstream, and each of those controllers has to reconstruct which of its own patients or citizens sat in the processor's dataset — from the processor's disclosure, not from its own telemetry. A SOC supporting a processor should assume it will be asked, within days and by hundreds of separate controllers, for per-controller scoping it will not have prepared; a SOC supporting a controller should know now which of its processors hold what, because that inventory is the only thing that turns a supplier's incident into a notification it can actually make.
