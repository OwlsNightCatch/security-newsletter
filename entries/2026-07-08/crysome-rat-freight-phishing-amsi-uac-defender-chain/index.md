title: "CrySome RAT freight-phishing chain: AMSI bypass, ICMLuaUtil UAC bypass and an open-source Defender-disruption tool"
headline: "CrySome RAT delivered via freight-rate phishing, chaining AMSI bypass, ICMLuaUtil UAC bypass and WinDefCtl"
summary: >
  LevelBlue SpiderLabs documented a freight-rate-confirmation phishing chain delivering CrySome, a .NET RAT, via a batch downloader, PowerShell AMSI bypass, ICMLuaUtil UAC bypass and the open-source WinDefCtl Defender-disruption utility. The operators lean almost entirely on off-the-shelf components, so detection must target the individual behaviours, not the final payload.

LevelBlue SpiderLabs documented a multi-stage infection chain delivering CrySome RAT — a modular .NET remote-access trojan the lab notes has been covered in prior public reporting — through spear-phishing emails impersonating freight-rate confirmations ([LevelBlue SpiderLabs, 2026-07-06](https://www.levelblue.com/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/from-phishing-to-persistence-a-crysome-rat-infection-chain-analysis)). Victims reach a fake portal hosting a batch-file downloader that launches PowerShell with an AMSI bypass (`T1059.001`, `T1562.001`) to fetch a stage-1 binary, which performs a UAC bypass via the ICMLuaUtil COM interface (`T1548.002`). Stage 2 adds Microsoft Defender exclusions and drops WinDefCtl — an open-source Defender-disruption utility masquerading as `svchost.exe` from `%TEMP%` — to disable real-time protection before launching the RAT. Persistence is a scheduled task ("CrysomeLoader") re-firing every five minutes (`T1053.005`); the RAT provides hidden VNC, arbitrary command execution and Chromium-browser credential theft, defeating Chrome's App-Bound Encryption via a decryptor DLL (`T1555.003`). **Defender takeaway:** the operators combine almost entirely open-source/off-the-shelf components rather than custom development, so — as LevelBlue notes — detecting the individual behavioural stages (AMSI-bypass PowerShell, ICMLuaUtil COM abuse, Defender-exclusion registry writes under `Software\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Exclusions`, svchost.exe from a non-System32 path) gives multiple disruption points before the RAT establishes; freight/logistics lures make transport-sector helpdesks a natural target, but the chain is theme-agnostic and transferable.
