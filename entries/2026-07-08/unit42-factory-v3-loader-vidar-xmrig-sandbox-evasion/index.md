headline: "Unit 42: Factory-v3 loaders use fake Authenticode signing and 491 MB file inflation to evade sandboxes"
summary: >
  Palo Alto Unit 42 documented a malvertising campaign distributing Vidar stealer and XMRig via loaders built with Factory-v3, a Go loader-builder. The loaders defeat detection with per-build UUIDs, fraudulent Authenticode certificates impersonating real firms, in-memory AMSI patching, MpClient.dll DLL-sideloading against Defender, and "file inflation" padding binaries to 491 MB to exceed sandbox upload limits.

Unit 42 documented a financially motivated malvertising campaign, active since April 2026, distributing Vidar stealer and the XMRig cryptominer via loaders built with "Factory-v3", a malware-as-a-service Go loader-builder ([Unit 42, 2026-07-07](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/vidar-stealer-xmrig-miner-campaign-analysis/)). Victims are lured to password-protected archives masquerading as cracked software; the Go loaders (43 samples, 27 unique build UUIDs — defeating hash-based detection) are signed with fraudulent Authenticode certificates impersonating real companies (JustWatch GmbH, later BleacherReport) (`T1553.002`), strip PE metadata, and DLL-sideload via a fake `MpClient.dll` export that hijacks Windows Defender's DLL search order to execute as `NisSrv.exe` from AppData (`T1574.002`). Before dropping the payload the loader patches AMSI in memory — resolving `AmsiScanBuffer` and overwriting its first six bytes to force an `E_INVALIDARG` return (`T1562.001`). The standout evasion is "file inflation": appending hundreds of megabytes of null bytes to push loader size to as high as 491 MB, exceeding the 50–100 MB detonation limits of many automated sandboxes. Persistence uses Run keys, scheduled tasks and startup-folder scripts, and each victim is fingerprinted via an 8-character HWID; the operator monitors yield through a Telegram channel branded "X3D MINER". **Defender takeaway:** with US/EU victim concentration and a builder that regenerates a unique binary per build, signature/hash detection is a dead end here — the durable hooks are the *evasion mechanics themselves*: file-inflation size/section heuristics, Authenticode signer-vs-product mismatch policy, Defender-binary DLL-sideload anomalies, and in-memory AMSI-patch telemetry.
