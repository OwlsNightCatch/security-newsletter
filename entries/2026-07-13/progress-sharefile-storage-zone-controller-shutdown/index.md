  Progress orders ShareFile Storage Zone Controller shutdown over a 'credible external threat' —
  day three, no patch or root cause disclosed
headline: >
  Progress tells all on-prem ShareFile Storage Zone Controller customers to power off their
  servers over an undisclosed 'credible external security threat'
summary: >
  Progress Software has ordered every customer running an on-premises ShareFile Storage Zone
  Controller (SZC) — the internet-facing IIS component bridging ShareFile's cloud to
  customer-managed storage — to physically shut the hosting server down over "a credible external
  security threat," first notified 2026-07-10 and still unresolved on the vendor status page as of
  2026-07-13. No CVE, root cause, patch or restart timeline has been published; the
  shutdown-not-patch instruction signals no fix yet exists. Exposure of the component concentrates
  in the US and Germany, giving Swiss/European on-prem file-exchange operators direct reason to
  act.

  Hold two facts separately: Progress has confirmed the shutdown order and characterised the
  threat as 'credible' but has not disclosed its technical nature, and has stated no evidence of
  unauthorized access to date. The background CVE-2026-2699/2701 pre-auth RCE chain in the same
  component (watchTowr, patched in 5.12.4) is the plausible working hypothesis but is not
  confirmed by Progress to be the current threat — treat it as compounding risk, not as
  attribution.

Progress Software has told every customer running an on-premises ShareFile Storage Zone Controller (SZC) — the self-hosted IIS component that lets ShareFile's SaaS front end store files on customer-controlled storage (local filesystem, SMB, SharePoint, S3/Azure) rather than in Progress's cloud — to manually power off the Windows server hosting it, citing "a credible external security threat" first notified to customers on 2026-07-10 ([BleepingComputer, 2026-07-10](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/progress-urges-sharefile-customers-to-shut-down-servers-over-credible-threat/)). Three days on, the vendor status page still lists the Storage Zone Controller service as not operational and under investigation ([Progress ShareFile status, 2026-07-13](https://status.sharefile.com/)), and Progress has disclosed neither a CVE, a root cause, nor a patch or safe-restart timeline; the mitigation on offer is a full shutdown rather than an update, with no fix published as of this run ([heise online, 2026-07-13](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Progress-warns-admins-Deactivate-ShareFile-11362439.html); [SecurityWeek, 2026-07-13](https://www.securityweek.com/progress-prompts-sharefile-storage-zone-controller-shutdown-amid-security-concerns/)). heise characterises the shutdown as a precautionary measure during an ongoing investigation. Progress states it has no indication of unauthorized access to any ShareFile account or data so far. Only on-premises SZC deployments are affected; cloud-only ShareFile tenants are not.

This sits on top of a chainable pre-auth RCE that watchTowr Labs disclosed in the same component in April 2026: CVE-2026-2699 (CVSS 9.8) is a CWE-698 execution-after-redirect authentication bypass in `/ConfigService/Admin.aspx`, where `Response.Redirect()` is called with the terminate flag set to false, so the admin page body still renders and executes after the browser is told to redirect to login; CVE-2026-2701 (CVSS 9.1) chains from that access, because the storage-location validation only checks writability, letting an attacker repoint the storage repository at the IIS web root and land an ASPX web shell ([watchTowr Labs, 2026-04-02](https://labs.watchtowr.com/youre-not-supposed-to-sharefile-with-everyone-progress-sharefile-pre-auth-rce-chain-cve-2026-2699-cve-2026-2701/)). Both were fixed in Storage Zone Controller 5.12.4 (the 6.x .NET-Core branch was unaffected); watchTowr counted roughly 30,000 internet-facing SZC instances at disclosure. Progress has not said whether the current threat relates to this chain or to a separate issue.

**Defender takeaway.** This is the same on-prem, internet-facing, managed-file-transfer-adjacent architecture class (ShareFile, MOVEit, GoAnywhere, Cleo) that has repeatedly produced mass pre-auth exploitation, and a vendor ordering customers to pull the plug rather than patch is a strong signal to treat any exposed SZC as untrusted until Progress publishes scope. Regardless of whether the July threat proves related to CVE-2026-2699/2701, any instance still on SZC 5.x below 5.12.4 carries a known, PoC-backed pre-auth RCE and should be upgraded or taken offline now. Since Progress has confirmed no mechanism, treat the CWE-698 chain as the working hunt hypothesis.

**Triage:** an authenticated administrator legitimately hits `/ConfigService/Admin.aspx` and receives a normal authenticated session; the anomaly for the known chain is a request to that path that returns a 302 whose response body nonetheless carries the full admin-panel HTML (the execution-after-redirect behaviour) rather than the redirect being honoured, followed by configuration changes to Zone/Primary-Zone-Controller/storage-repository fields outside a change window — and, downstream, an `.aspx` file appearing under a StorageCenter webroot subdirectory that is not part of the vendor's shipped file set.

## Update — 2026-07-14T12:50:00Z

Two developments harden the picture around Progress's emergency ShareFile Storage Zone Controller (SZC) shutdown order. First, the shutdown was not precautionary in the abstract: the alert "arrived the same day that independent honeypots began detecting active, in-the-wild attempts to exploit" the pre-auth authentication-bypass flaw CVE-2026-2699, with Shadowserver Foundation honeypots first recording those attempts on Friday 2026-07-10 ([BankInfoSecurity, 2026-07-13](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/progress-urges-sharefile-shutdown-over-credible-threat-a-32210)). This moves the flaw's status from PoC-public to actively exploited. Second, defenders responded at scale — the number of internet-exposed Storage Zone Controllers fell from watchTowr's April count of about 30,000 to roughly 1,000 by 2026-07-13, evidence of widespread emergency power-downs ([BankInfoSecurity, 2026-07-13](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/progress-urges-sharefile-shutdown-over-credible-threat-a-32210)). Progress restored ShareFile cloud-service access for SZC customers but continues to require the on-prem controllers themselves stay powered off pending its investigation, and still reports no evidence of unauthorized access to customer data ([The Register, 2026-07-13](https://www.theregister.com/security/2026/07/13/progress-orders-emergency-sharefile-server-shutdown-over-mystery-security-threat/5270281); [Progress ShareFile status, 2026-07-13](https://status.sharefile.com/)).

Recorded Future analyst Allan Liska publicly assessed that the pattern "smells like CL0P ransomware group activity," pointing to Clop's long record of mass-exploiting secure file-transfer software (Accellion FTA, GoAnywhere, MOVEit, Cleo Harmony, and Oracle E-Business Suite) ([BankInfoSecurity, 2026-07-13](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/progress-urges-sharefile-shutdown-over-credible-threat-a-32210)). This is a named researcher's hypothesis, not an attribution: Progress has identified no actor and disclosed no root cause.

**Defender takeaway.** The one-day earlier guidance — treat any exposed SZC as untrusted and keep it powered off rather than patched — is now backed by confirmed in-the-wild exploitation, so it should carry more weight, not less, for any organisation that has not yet acted. Exposure concentrates in the US and Germany, keeping this directly relevant to European on-prem file-exchange operators. The recommended state remains a full power-off of on-prem Storage Zone Controllers until Progress publishes scope; the original entry's shutdown and bounded-compromise-check actions still stand unchanged.

## Update — 2026-07-14T20:21:02Z

Progress Software has confirmed the root cause behind its emergency ShareFile Storage Zone Controller (SZC) shutdown order: a high-severity path-traversal vulnerability affecting SZC versions 5.x and 6.x that lets an authenticated administrative user read arbitrary files accessible to the application's service account, write malicious content to server directories, and enumerate the filesystem layout ([BleepingComputer, 2026-07-14](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/progress-confirms-sharefile-zero-day-flaw-behind-storage-zone-shutdown/)) — a CWE-22-class flaw reachable through the SZC's internet-facing IIS component. Progress has shipped patched versions 5.12.5 and 6.0.2, and a CVE identifier is reserved but will not be published for two weeks. The vendor states it has "no indication of unauthorized access to any ShareFile customer account or data," a claim that sits alongside this run's earlier finding that Shadowserver honeypots recorded in-the-wild exploitation attempts against the same component from 2026-07-10. Progress's status page confirms Storage Zone Controller customer access "is currently being restored," with recovery instructions issued directly to account owners ([Progress — ShareFile Status Page, 2026-07-14](https://status.sharefile.com/)), closing out the multi-day outage that began with the 2026-07-10 shutdown order.

**Defender takeaway:** the new detail is the fix — patched versions (5.12.5, 6.0.2) and a named vulnerability class (path traversal, authenticated-admin scope) that the two prior entries in this thread lacked. Any organization that took SZC offline under the shutdown order should patch to the fixed build and complete Progress's recovery procedure before re-exposing the component; do not re-enable an unpatched controller. **Triage:** path-traversal exploitation of this component surfaces in the SZC's IIS/web request telemetry as requests carrying directory-traversal sequences to the storage-controller endpoints and in file-access telemetry as the service account reading or writing paths outside its normal content directories — legitimate SZC operation confines the service account to its configured storage paths, so out-of-tree file access under that account is the discriminator.
