Broadcom's Symantec and Carbon Black documented a targeted espionage operation (Oct 2025–Mar 2026) against a senior executive at an unnamed global stock exchange ([Broadcom/Symantec, 2026-06-03](https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/stock-exchange-espionage) · [SecurityWeek, 2026-06-03](https://www.securityweek.com/hackers-target-global-stock-exchange-in-espionage-operation/)). The actor persisted with masqueraded binaries (`armsvc.exe`, `oneservice.exe` — `T1036.005`) and scheduled tasks, then ran a custom Aspose-based OST stealer to incrementally exfiltrate the target's entire Outlook mailbox in small batches via the Dropbox API and OneDrive Personal (`T1114.001`, `T1567.002`), deliberately using hard-coded Microsoft IP addresses instead of hostnames to defeat DNS-based detection. Tooling also included FRPC, SharpDecryptPwd and Secretsdump (`T1003.001`). No attribution is offered; the assessed motive is intelligence collection. Detection concepts: scheduled-task creation by non-SYSTEM processes (EID 4698 / Sysmon 12), `.ost` reads by processes other than `Outlook.exe` (Sysmon 11), and outbound HTTPS to Dropbox API endpoints from non-browser processes.
