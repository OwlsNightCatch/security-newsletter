Huntress detailed an unpatched NTLMv2-leak in the Windows `search:` protocol handler: a crafted link with a `crumb=location:` parameter pointing at an attacker UNC path makes Windows open an outbound SMB (TCP 445) connection and expose the user's Net-NTLMv2 challenge-response for offline cracking or relay ([Huntress, 2026-06-03](https://www.huntress.com/blog/unpatched-ntlm-leak-windows-search-uri-handler) · [The Hacker News, 2026-06-03](https://thehackernews.com/2026/06/unpatched-windows-search-uri.html)). The bug class is structurally identical to the Snipping Tool `ms-screensketch:` handler leak (CVE-2026-33829) patched in April; Huntress reported the `search:` variant a day later but Microsoft declined a CVE or fix, assessing it as Moderate severity — below the Important/Critical threshold of its servicing bar. Forced-authentication mapping is `T1187`. The single highest-value control neutralises the whole URI-handler leak class: block outbound SMB (TCP 445/139) at host firewall and perimeter for endpoints that don't need external shares, and enable EPA on NTLM-accepting services.
