Huntress documented a DesckVB RAT chain from a May 2026 IR engagement that abuses Google DoubleClick Campaign Manager click-tracking for reputation laundering: a German-named HTML attachment (`Bestellung_2026.html` — "order") does a zero-second meta-refresh to a high-reputation `ad.doubleclick.net` URL that allowlist-based mail/web filters pass transparently, then steers to a "Download PDF" landing page delivering a JavaScript loader ([Huntress, 2026-06-03](https://www.huntress.com/blog/malspam-to-deskcvb-rat-delivery-chain-analysis)). The loader runs a .NET assembly via process hollowing (`T1055.012`) after patching AMSI and ETW at the native-API level (`T1562.001`) to blind Windows telemetry; persistence is set before C2 over raw TCP. German-language purchase-order lures point at DACH enterprises.
**Why it matters to us:** the DoubleClick hop defeats domain-reputation allowlisting at the gateway — flag HTML email attachments containing meta-refresh to ad-network domains, and watch for runtime patching of `AmsiScanBuffer` / ETW from `node`/script-spawned process trees rather than relying on the redirect domain.
