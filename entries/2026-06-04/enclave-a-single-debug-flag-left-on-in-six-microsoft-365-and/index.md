Researchers at Enclave found a shared Android SDK across six Microsoft 365 apps shipped `setIsDebugMode(true)` in production, disabling the AccountManager check that restricts token sharing to trusted Microsoft apps — so any co-installed third-party app could silently obtain long-lived OAuth tokens for the signed-in Microsoft identity with no prompt ([SecurityWeek, 2026-06-02](https://www.securityweek.com/exclusive-how-one-line-of-code-put-billions-of-microsoft-android-app-downloads-at-risk/) · [The Hacker News, 2026-06-03](https://thehackernews.com/2026/06/microsoft-365-android-apps-let-any-app.html)). Affected: Word (CVE-2026-41101), PowerPoint (CVE-2026-41102), Excel (CVE-2026-42832), Microsoft 365 Copilot (CVE-2026-41100), Loop and OneNote — collectively billions of installs; Teams was unaffected because its flag was correctly `false`. Tokens granted read/write to Exchange mail, OneDrive and Calendar. Microsoft fixed all six in the 12 May 2026 cycle; no ITW reported pre-patch. Enforce minimum-version compliance for these apps via Intune/MDM on BYOD fleets and, where logs exist, review AccountManager token requests from non-Microsoft packages.
