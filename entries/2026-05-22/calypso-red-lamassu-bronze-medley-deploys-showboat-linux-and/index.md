Lumen's Black Lotus Labs and PwC Threat Intelligence disclosed on 2026-05-21 two purpose-built implants used by the China-aligned espionage cluster Calypso (also tracked as Red Lamassu, Bronze Medley — active since at least mid-2022 based on binary upload and victim telemetry) in a multi-year campaign against telecommunications providers ([Lumen Black Lotus Labs, 2026-05-21](https://www.lumen.com/blog/en-us/introducing-showboat-a-new-malware-family-taunts-defenses-and-targets-international-telecom-firms) · [PwC Threat Intelligence, 2026-05-21](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/red-lamassu-open-season.html)). Confirmed victims include a Middle East ISP, an Afghanistan ISP, and entities in Azerbaijan, the US, and Ukraine; European telecoms are within the actor's documented targeting pattern. Showboat is a modular ELF binary masquerading as a Linux kernel worker thread (`kworker` — `T1036.005 Masquerade: Match Legitimate Name`) providing remote shell (`T1059.004`), bidirectional file transfer, SOCKS5 proxy to internal network segments (`T1090.001 Internal Proxy`), and a `hide` command that fetches a rootkit payload from Pastebin at runtime (`T1102.001 Dead Drop Resolver`) — the C2 payload is exfiltrated base64-encoded inside PNG image fields to blend with web traffic ([Lumen Black Lotus Labs, 2026-05-21](https://www.lumen.com/blog/en-us/introducing-showboat-a-new-malware-family-taunts-defenses-and-targets-international-telecom-firms)). JFMBackdoor, the Windows counterpart, is delivered via DLL sideloading (`T1574.002`): a batch script drops a legitimate signed executable that loads the malicious DLL, providing remote shell, file operations, SOCKS5 proxy, and self-removal ([PwC Threat Intelligence, 2026-05-21](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/cybersecurity/cyber-threat-intelligence/red-lamassu-open-season.html)). C2 infrastructure clusters to Chengdu, Sichuan-geolocated IP ranges; X.509 certificate SAN/CN patterns link the victim set ([Lumen Black Lotus Labs, 2026-05-21](https://www.lumen.com/blog/en-us/introducing-showboat-a-new-malware-family-taunts-defenses-and-targets-international-telecom-firms)). Detection: hunt for `kworker` ELF processes whose parent is not `kthreadd` (PID 2) on Linux telecom servers (auditd EXECVE or Sysmon for Linux EID 1 parent-pid check); alert on unsigned DLLs loaded by vendor-signed executables (Sysmon EID 7: signed process, unsigned module); flag egress DNS queries or HTTP GET to pastebin.com from daemon-context processes.
