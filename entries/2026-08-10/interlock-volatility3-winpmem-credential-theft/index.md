summary: >
  Sophos's incident-response team investigated a March 2026 Interlock intrusion in which the operator
  captured a full physical-memory image with WinPmem and then ran Volatility3's Windows credential

  host. Initial access was a ClickFix paste-and-run lure reached through a search result, and the
  chain ran to domain-controller compromise inside roughly 26 hours including a deliberate day-long
  pause. The defensive problem is that both binaries are legitimate DFIR tooling, so their presence
  and their command shapes are indistinguishable from a real investigation on artifact alone —
  Sophos's own discriminator was that the customer knew of no legitimate use.

Sophos's Emergency Incident Response team has published an intrusion in which the Interlock ransomware operator — which Sophos's Counter Threat Unit tracks as GOLD EMBRACE, active since September 2024 against North American and European targets — used the defender's own toolkit for credential access ([Sophos X-Ops, 2026-08-07](https://www.sophos.com/en-us/blog/2608-volatility-interlock/)). On the first compromised host, the actor acquired a full physical-memory image using WinPmem, the open-source physical-memory acquisition tool, and then ran Volatility3's Windows plugins against that image offline: the hash-dump plugin to recover account material from the SAM and SYSTEM hive structures resident in memory, and the cached-domain-credential plugin for cached logons. No commodity credential dumper was involved in that step.

The chain around it is otherwise conventional and worth reading for its timing. The user reached a compromised but reputable site through a search result, and five seconds later the page read the clipboard — the ClickFix fingerprint. Eight seconds later, thirteen seconds into the chain, the user pasted an attacker-supplied command into the Run dialog, which fetched a second-stage script and installed a remote-access trojan to run at startup; registry Run-key persistence landed about twenty-five minutes in. The operator then paused for roughly a day before resuming with domain-group enumeration over LDAP, a service-principal-name query consistent with Kerberoasting, and a lateral move to the domain controller over RDP. On the third day, using a compromised domain-administrator account, persistence was re-established through a scheduled task named to imitate the built-in disk-defragmentation task and running a bundled Node.js interpreter. Sophos records the outcome as credential dumping including cloud credentials, access to sensitive files, new domain-administrator accounts, and tampering with endpoint protection — and notes that, across the estate, not all endpoints were in fact running protection of any sort.

The reason this is worth a defender's attention is not novelty of the malware but the inversion it forces. Memory acquisition and Volatility analysis are exactly what an incident responder does, so the on-host artifacts of the attack step and of a legitimate engagement are the same artifacts. Sophos is explicit that adversarial use "would leave similar traces" to a DFIR investigation, a security assessment, or malware analysis, and that what resolved it in this case was that the customer knew of no legitimate activity of that kind.

**Triage:** memory-acquisition and memory-analysis binaries executing on an endpoint are not anomalous by artifact — they are anomalous by authorisation and by context. The discriminators that survive are organisational rather than technical: whether an engagement, assessment or analysis was actually scheduled on that host at that time; whether the binaries arrived through the change process that normally delivers them or were dropped into a user-writable path; and whether the acquisition ran on a host with a current, unexplained persistence artifact and recent Run-key or scheduled-task creation. A memory image being written to disk by a process whose parent is a user shell or a downloaded stager, rather than by a responder's tooling deployed through management infrastructure, is the sequence worth alerting on. **Defender takeaway:** any detection logic that allowlists forensic tooling by name or hash gives this actor a free credential-access stage. Treat acquisition and analysis binaries as privileged tooling whose execution requires a matching authorised engagement — and make the authorisation record something a SOC can query during triage, because without it there is no technical discriminator left.
