Microsoft Defender researchers found a malicious Chrome extension ("Search for perplexity ai") that abused Chrome's search-settings override API — specifically the `suggest_url` parameter — to exfiltrate every character typed into the address bar in real time before redirecting to legitimate results ([Microsoft Security Blog, 2026-06-29](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/06/29/chromium-extension-uses-airelated-branding-redirect-browser-search/) · [The Hacker News, 2026-06-30](https://thehackernews.com/2026/06/malicious-perplexity-chrome-extension.html)). It used `declarativeNetRequest` rules for a two-hop redirect: the first hop shipped the query plus live autocomplete keystrokes to attacker infrastructure (server-side Node.js logging full headers, UA, and source IP), the second returned real results so the user noticed nothing. Google pulled the extension after disclosure. It is part of a broader AI-brand-impersonation trend Microsoft is tracking.

**Why it matters to us:** AI-brand impersonation is an easy lure for staff reaching for popular assistant tools. Enforce an enterprise extension allowlist via Group Policy / Intune, and monitor Chromium policy for unexpected changes to `DefaultSearchProviderSuggestURL` on endpoints with access to sensitive systems.
