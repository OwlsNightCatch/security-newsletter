No technical root-cause detail (initial-access vector, MFA state, OAuth-consent vs credential phishing) was disclosed by PDAG or either outlet — flagged as a gap, not inferred. Confidence medium accordingly."

Psychiatrische Dienste Aargau AG (PDAG), a Swiss cantonal psychiatric-care provider, disclosed that unauthorised parties gained access to individual `@pdag.ch` email accounts and abused them to send spam and phishing messages to external recipients ([SwissCybersecurity.net, 2026-07-09](https://www.swisscybersecurity.net/news/2026-07-09/psychiatrische-dienste-aargau-werden-opfer-eines-phishing-angriffs); [Inside IT, 2026-07-08](https://www.inside-it.ch/cyberangriff-auf-psychiatrische-dienste-aargau-20260708)). On discovery, PDAG locked the affected accounts immediately, reset passwords for all employees as a precaution, notified the competent cantonal and national authorities, and engaged internal and external IT-security experts plus its external ICT service provider to analyse and harden. By its current assessment the incident is limited to account misuse for outbound spam/phishing, with no indication that patient data was accessed or exfiltrated; the organisation is warning recipients about suspicious mail purporting to come from its domain.

No technical root cause — the initial-access vector into the mailboxes, whether MFA was enforced, or whether the takeover was via credential phishing or an OAuth consent grant — was disclosed, so the mechanism is unknown rather than assumed. The pattern maps to `T1566 Phishing` for the initial access and `T1586.002 Compromise Accounts: Email Accounts` for the takeover and downstream abuse. **Defender takeaway:** this is a minor incident in impact (no data breach confirmed) but a directly relevant one for the Swiss public/health sector — the containment (mass lockout plus all-staff reset) was correct, and the detection lesson it underlines for any organisation with a cantonal or federal `.ch` mail presence is that per-mailbox outbound anomaly detection and DMARC-alignment monitoring catch a compromised-legitimate-sender case that inbound-only phishing controls do not.
