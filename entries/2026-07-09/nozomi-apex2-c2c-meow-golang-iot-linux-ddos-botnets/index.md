headline: "Two Golang DDoS botnets, Apex2 and c2c/meow, flood exposed Telnet/SSH Linux and IoT with fake-systemd persistence and passwordless-sudo escalation"
summary: >
  Nozomi Networks Labs details two Golang DDoS botnet families caught via honeypots this spring:
  Apex2 (Telnet brute-force, Linux+Windows builds, a Cloudflare-bypass HTTP flood plus UDP/TLS
  floods) and c2c/meow (SSH-delivered, escalates via passwordless sudo, persists as a fake
  systemd 'cpufreqd' service). Neither is sophisticated, but the point for defenders is the pace:
  exposed Telnet/SSH management interfaces on IoT and embedded-Linux keep getting repurposed for
  DDoS faster than before — directly relevant to OT-adjacent estates in energy, water and transport.

Nozomi Networks Labs' AI-assisted honeypot triage flagged two Golang-based DDoS botnet samples this spring that stand out from the routine volume of Mirai-derived variants: Apex2 and c2c (distributed under the filename "meow") ([Nozomi Networks Labs, 2026-07-06](https://www.nozominetworks.com/blog/spring-botnet-floods-golang-malware-targets-exposed-iot-systems)). Apex2 is a direct structural evolution of the earlier Apex botnet: infection begins with Telnet connections and credential brute-forcing, followed by download-and-execute of the Golang payload, which registers with its C2 over a plaintext protocol (host OS/architecture) and ships builds for Linux (arm, arm64, mipsle, ppc64) and Windows (386, amd64). Its named flood commands include `cf` (an HTTP(S) flood specifically tuned to bypass Cloudflare via randomized User-Agent lists and long keep-alive timeouts), `udp`/`pps`, `discord`/`game` UDP floods, and three TLS-flood variants (`tls`, `tlsplus`, `tlsplusbypass`). c2c/meow is architecturally simpler — a Golang flooder with no built-in propagation (a separate SSH scanner handles brute-forcing and delivery) that authenticates to a hardcoded C2 over plaintext JSON-over-TCP, checks for passwordless sudo (`sudo -n true`) to self-escalate, then persists by copying itself to `/usr/local/bin/cpufreqd` and registering a fake systemd unit masquerading as a "CPU Frequency Daemon" — supporting ten flood-module types (icmp, dnsudp, udp, http, directhttp, fasthttp, betterhttp, tcp, tcphandshake, dnstcp).

Nozomi's stated point for defenders is that neither family is sophisticated — both lean on commodity Golang tooling, weak/default credentials and exposed Telnet/SSH interfaces rather than novel exploitation — and that the lack of sophistication does not reduce the risk at scale, because the build-and-deploy cycle for such botnets is getting faster. ATT&CK mapping: `T1110 Brute Force` (Telnet/SSH), `T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer`, `T1548.003 Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Sudo` (c2c's passwordless-sudo self-escalation), `T1543.002 Create or Modify System Process: Systemd Service` with `T1036.005 Masquerading` (the fake cpufreqd unit), and `T1498 Network Denial of Service` for the flood modules. **Defender takeaway:** this is not a novel threat but a concrete hunt package for the OT-adjacent and embedded-Linux estates in the constituency's energy, water and transport remit — the fake-systemd-service naming, the `sudo -n true` escalation probe, and plaintext-JSON C2 are all cheap, durable detections, and the durable fix is the unglamorous one of removing internet-exposed Telnet/SSH and default credentials on IoT and embedded devices.
