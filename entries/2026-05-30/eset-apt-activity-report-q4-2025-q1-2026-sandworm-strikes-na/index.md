ESET published its APT Activity Report covering October 2025 through March 2026 on 28 May 2026 ([ESET WeLiveSecurity, 2026-05-28](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/eset-apt-activity-report-q4-2025-q1-2026/)). EU- and NATO-relevant findings for public-sector defenders: Sandworm (Russia/GRU) intensified destructive winter operations against Ukrainian infrastructure and targeted a Polish energy company in December 2025 — a NATO member state critical-infrastructure attack attributed with medium confidence; this represents continued Sandworm willingness to conduct wiper operations beyond Ukraine's borders. Sednit/APT28 deployed Covenant and BeardShell implants against Ukrainian military, drone manufacturers, and logistics companies. Lazarus Group ran Operation DreamJob targeting European drone manufacturers — ESET assesses this as technology acquisition for North Korea's weapons programme. Operation DangerousPassword compromised the axios JavaScript library (100+ million weekly npm downloads), injecting trojanised code and demonstrating ongoing North Korea supply-chain interest in developer ecosystem targeting. UNC5221 (China-nexus) deployed a new implant assessed as part of the SPAWN toolset, specifically targeting Ivanti VPN appliances (Connect Secure, Policy Secure); organisations running unpatched Ivanti VPN should audit for SPAWN toolset artefacts including SPAWNANT installer, SPAWNMOLE tunneller, SPAWNSNAIL SSH backdoor, and SPAWNSLOTH log-tampering utility. The report PDF is available at `https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/en/papers/threat-reports/eset-apt-activity-report-q4-2025-q1-2026.pdf`. Key defender actions: (a) confirm Sandworm wiper detection capability (file-destruction followed by MBR/VBR overwrite patterns, VSS deletion); (b) review Ivanti VPN logs for SPAWN footprints per [CISA AA24-060A](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-060a) indicators; (c) audit npm dependency trees for axios versions <1.8.0 or 0.x released after the DangerousPassword campaign window.
