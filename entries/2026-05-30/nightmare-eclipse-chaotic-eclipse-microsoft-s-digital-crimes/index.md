**UPDATE (originally covered 2026-W21):** Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit issued a formal public statement on 28–29 May 2026 calling uncoordinated zero-day releases "never justifiable" and warning its DCU would "continue bringing cases against these actors and those that enable their criminal activity" ([The Record, 2026-05-29](https://therecord.media/microsoft-calls-zero-day-releases-never-justifiable-as-researcher-threatens-more)). The pseudonymous researcher Nightmare Eclipse / Chaotic Eclipse responded by threatening a new vulnerability release on 14 July 2026 (the next Patch Tuesday).

Of the six Windows vulnerabilities the researcher has released since early April: BlueHammer (CVE-2026-33825), UnDefend (CVE-2026-45498), and RedSun (CVE-2026-41091) are patched and saw confirmed in-the-wild exploitation following PoC publication. YellowKey (CVE-2026-45585 — BitLocker bypass via Windows Recovery Environment, requiring physical access), GreenPlasma (LPE class), and MiniPlasma remain unpatched as of 30 May 2026. MiniPlasma specifically abuses the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver (`cldflt.sys`) to achieve a SYSTEM shell from a standard user session on fully-patched Windows 11; the root cause is assessed as an incomplete remediation of CVE-2020-17103 (no CVE yet assigned to MiniPlasma itself).

The July 14 release deadline should be treated as a hard date for resolving any outstanding Windows LPE chain gaps. Defenders on Windows 11 estates should monitor for `cldflt.sys`-related anomalies and consider AppLocker/WDAC policies blocking unsigned executables from low-privileged user sessions while patches are pending. Next Patch Tuesday: 10 June 2026.
