The `polyfill[.]io` CDN domain — seized and weaponised in the June 2024 supply-chain attack that affected more than 100,000 sites — became active again in late May 2026 and began answering with HTTP 401 authentication challenges, which browsers render as native credential dialog boxes ([BleepingComputer, 2026-06-05](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/suspicious-polyfill-login-prompts-pop-up-on-toshiba-muji-websites/)). Any site still loading a `<script src="…polyfill[.]io…">` tag — a failure documented across many organisations since 2024 — now prompts visitors for credentials in a dialog that appears to originate from the trusted site. Toshiba published a warning on 2026-06-02 telling users to click *Cancel* without entering anything ([Toshiba, 2026-06-02](https://www.global.toshiba/jp/top/info-20260602.html)); Muji issued a parallel notice stating it had not confirmed unauthorised access or data leakage ([BleepingComputer, 2026-06-05](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/suspicious-polyfill-login-prompts-pop-up-on-toshiba-muji-websites/)). This is mechanically distinct from the 2024 redirect-to-malicious-JavaScript attack: the harm here is HTTP-401-induced credential phishing, not script injection, so neither party has confirmed exfiltration — but both advised affected users to change passwords. Maps to `T1195.002` (Compromise Software Supply Chain).
**Why it matters to us:** The exposure is entirely a function of stale third-party references, which most organisations underestimate. Grep all rendered HTML, CMS templates, and CDN-inclusion lists for `polyfill[.]io` with any subdomain or path; replace with the legitimate `polyfill.com` / `polyfill.top` mirrors or self-hosted polyfills, and enforce Subresource Integrity (SRI) on all third-party scripts. Web-proxy/SWG logs showing 401 responses from `polyfill[.]io` pinpoint pages that still load the script.
