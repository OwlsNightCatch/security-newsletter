headline: "Magecart family runs its skimmer out of Stripe — payload in customer metadata, stolen cards exfiltrated back through api.stripe.com"
summary: "A Magecart variant hides its skimmer inside Stripe customer metadata and exfiltrates stolen cards back through api.stripe.com as fake customer records — defeating CSP and WAF rules that universally allow-list Stripe. Detection must shift to server-side GTM-container integrity (Sansec, 2026-06-04)."

Sansec's forensics team documented a card-skimming family that routes both payload delivery and exfiltration entirely through Stripe's legitimate API ([Sansec, 2026-06-04](https://sansec.io/research/stripe-api-skimmer-infrastructure)). The actor creates a Stripe customer object and stores the skimmer JavaScript in that customer's metadata fields; at checkout the skimmer is fetched from `api.stripe.com`, captures full card number, CVV, expiry and billing address, then writes the stolen data *back* to Stripe by creating new fake customer records — so both inbound payload and outbound theft look like ordinary Stripe API traffic ([BleepingComputer, 2026-06-04](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/credit-card-theft-campaign-abuses-stripe-to-host-stolen-payment-info/)). The entry point is a malicious Google Tag Manager (GTM) container injected into checkout pages of Magento / Adobe Commerce stores; the skimmer-hosting Stripe customer record was created 2025-12-24, indicating a campaign running since at least late 2025. Maps to `T1059.007` (JavaScript) and `T1071.001` (Application Layer Protocol: Web).
**Why it matters to us:** `api.stripe.com` is universally allow-listed in CSP `script-src`/`connect-src` and WAF egress rules on payment sites, so the standard "block unknown exfil endpoints" control is blind to this. Detection has to move server-side: inventory GTM container IDs against an approved list, alert on Stripe customer-creation events that don't map to real orders, inspect customer-metadata fields for encoded JavaScript, and run file-integrity monitoring on checkout-page tag configuration rather than relying on browser-side CSP.
