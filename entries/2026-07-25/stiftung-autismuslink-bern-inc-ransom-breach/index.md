headline: "Bern foundation's own notice confirms exfiltration and server encryption; INC Ransom posts a leak-site claim"
summary: >
  Stiftung Autismuslink, a Bern-based Swiss foundation serving young people with autism, published a signed
  notice confirming a cyberattack detected 2026-06-29 in which "larger volumes of data" were exfiltrated and
  its server temporarily encrypted; the INC Ransom RaaS group posted a matching leak-site claim on 2026-07-24.
  Exposed data includes cantonal education-directorate (BKD) contracts, Swiss disability-insurance (IV) service
  agreements and the complete 2016-2023 client dossier archive — directly relevant to Swiss cantonal/communal
  social-services and education defenders.

Stiftung Autismuslink — a Bern-based foundation providing school, coaching and vocational-integration services to adolescents and young adults with autism — published a signed victim notice confirming a cyberattack: "Ende Juni wurde unsere IT-Infrastruktur Opfer eines Cyberangriffs. Nach aktueller Erkenntnis wurden grössere Datenmengen durch die Angreifer abgezogen und unser Server vorübergehend verschlüsselt" (end of June our IT infrastructure fell victim to a cyberattack; larger volumes of data were exfiltrated and our server temporarily encrypted) ([Stiftung Autismuslink, 2026-07](https://autismuslink.ch/wp-content/uploads/2026_07_Informationsschreiben_zum_Serverausfall_Extern.pdf)). The foundation states the irregularity was detected Monday 2026-06-29, the system was immediately isolated from the internet, an external IT provider (Infoguard) was engaged for forensics the same day, the relevant authorities were notified and a criminal complaint filed with the police. Backups were verified unaffected. The INC Ransom (Incransom) double-extortion group posted a leak-site claim against autismuslink.ch on 2026-07-24 consistent in victim identity and timeline ([Ransomware.live, 2026-07-24](https://www.ransomware.live/id/YXV0aXNtdXNsaW5rLmNoQGluY3JhbnNvbQ==)) — a relatively rare case of same-day victim self-disclosure and leak-site claim converging.

The disclosure event (site notice plus leak-site claim) is what falls in this window; the underlying intrusion dates to late June. What makes it relevant beyond a single victim is the data class: per the foundation, affected material includes service agreements with the Swiss disability insurance (IV) and a cantonal education/culture directorate (BKD), teacher contracts, doctors' certificates and the complete client dossier archive 2016-2023 for minors and young adults. **Defender takeaway:** the relevance is the target class, not this single victim — Swiss cantonal and communal social-services and education bodies running comparable long-lived case-management archives of highly sensitive personal data on minors and vulnerable adults share Autismuslink's exposure profile, and INC Ransom is a double-extortion RaaS active since ~2023 that both encrypts and exfiltrates for leverage. The victim's own account is the practical lesson: immediate network isolation on first detection and verified-clean, segmented backups are what turned a server-encryption event into a recoverable one here, and are the controls that most directly determine whether a comparable intrusion becomes a full outage.
