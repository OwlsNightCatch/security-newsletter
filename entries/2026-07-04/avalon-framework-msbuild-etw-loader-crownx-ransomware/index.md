headline: "**Avalon** framework chains a signed-binary MSBuild loader, ETW/AMSI patching and the CrownX ransomware payload in one implant"
summary: >
  Blackpoint Cyber's Adversary Pursuit Group detailed Avalon, a previously
  undocumented Windows malware framework delivered by a legal-themed phishing
  lure and an ISO-mounted LNK that proxy-executes inline C# through MSBuild.exe,
  patches ETW/AMSI, and consolidates browser/wallet/credential-manager theft,
  admin-share lateral movement and the embedded CrownX ransomware component in a
  single payload. Detection engineers on Windows fleets — including public-sector
  endpoints — should tighten controls on trusted-developer-utility execution.

Blackpoint Cyber's Adversary Pursuit Group published an analysis of **Avalon**, a modular Windows malware framework recovered from an endpoint and not previously documented ([Blackpoint Cyber, 2026-07-02](https://blackpointcyber.com/blog/avalons-path-from-legal-lure-to-crownx-ransom-capabilities/)). Delivery starts with a spoofed legal-document phishing email pointing to a password-protected archive; the mounted image contains a weaponised LNK that presents a document-themed filename behind a Microsoft Edge icon so the victim believes they are opening a secure PDF rather than launching commands ([Blackpoint Cyber, 2026-07-02](https://blackpointcyber.com/blog/avalons-path-from-legal-lure-to-crownx-ransom-capabilities/)). The shortcut runs `cmd.exe`, which invokes `MSBuild.exe` against a malicious project file carrying inline C# — a trusted-developer-utility proxy-execution chain (`T1127.001`) — and the managed downloader then patches ETW and AMSI functions with return stubs (`T1562.001`) before pulling an encrypted PE payload over HTTPS with certificate-validation bypass.

The recovered payload is notable for consolidating capability that would previously have been spread across several discrete families: browser, cryptocurrency-wallet, Discord/Teams, RDP-session, SSH-key and Windows Credential Manager theft (`T1555`, `T1552.001`), lateral movement over admin shares and scheduled tasks (`T1021.002`, `T1053.005`), and the embedded **CrownX** ransomware component that AES-GCM-encrypts a targeted extension set and disables Volume Shadow Copies, WinRE and System Restore to inhibit recovery (`T1490`, `T1486`) ([Blackpoint Cyber, 2026-07-02](https://blackpointcyber.com/blog/avalons-path-from-legal-lure-to-crownx-ransom-capabilities/)). Secondary reporting describes the framework as bringing these diverse functions under one umbrella ([The Hacker News, 2026-07-03](https://thehackernews.com/2026/07/new-avalon-malware-framework-packs.html)). Defence evasion includes syscall-obfuscation techniques (HalosGate/TartarusGate) and named checks against a broad list of EDR products. Blackpoint assesses that the framework "bears the hallmarks of AI assisted development, assembled rapidly from functional components with little regard for tradecraft refinement or operational security" ([Blackpoint Cyber, 2026-07-02](https://blackpointcyber.com/blog/avalons-path-from-legal-lure-to-crownx-ransom-capabilities/)) — a signal that a single operator can now assemble multi-stage capability quickly, even if the tradecraft is sloppy.

**Defender takeaway:** the operational chokepoint is the same regardless of who or what wrote the code — trusted-developer-utility proxy execution and defence-tampering. Alert on `MSBuild.exe` launched by `cmd.exe` referencing a project/temp file outside a build pipeline (Sysmon EID 1 with parent-image filtering), flag ETW trace-session termination and AMSI in-memory patch signatures via image-load and memory-permission-change telemetry, and block `MSBuild.exe`/`InstallUtil.exe`/`csc.exe` on non-developer endpoints with WDAC or AppLocker. Enforcing Credential Guard and LSA protection reduces the value of a successful credential-harvesting stage.
