BSI CERT-Bund advisory WID-SEC-2026-1981 (2026-06-17) rates the aggregate severity of the Zammad 7.1 release as "hoch" (high): an attacker can chain the patched flaws to gain administrator privileges, bypass security controls, manipulate or disclose data, or trigger denial-of-service ([BSI CERT-Bund, 2026-06-17](https://wid.cert-bund.de/portal/wid/securityadvisory?name=WID-SEC-2026-1981)). Zammad — a widely-deployed open-source helpdesk/ticketing system common in German, Austrian and Swiss public-sector IT service desks — released version 7.1 on 2026-06-16 addressing 13 issues now tracked exclusively as GitHub Security Advisories ([Zammad, 2026-06-16](https://zammad.com/en/product/releases/zammad-7-1)); individual CVE identifiers are not yet enumerated in public NVD/CSAF records. Any admin-privilege path in a ticketing system exposes internal IT operations data and staff credentials; internet-exposed instances behind a reverse proxy are highest risk. Upgrade to 7.1 and hunt Zammad audit logs for unexpected role escalations and admin-API calls (e.g. to role/user-management endpoints) from unprivileged sessions.
