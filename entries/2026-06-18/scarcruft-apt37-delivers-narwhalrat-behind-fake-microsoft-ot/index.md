Genians Security Center attributed a new campaign to ScarCruft / APT37 (North Korea nexus) deploying a previously-undocumented RAT it calls NarwhalRAT ([Genians, 2026-06-16](https://www.genians.co.kr/en/blog/threat_intelligence/narwhalrat)). The lure is a spearphishing email impersonating a Microsoft multi-factor authentication / OTP security alert; the attached ZIP carries a Windows shortcut (LNK) that launches PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` to pull a batch loader, which establishes persistence via a scheduled task running on a one-minute interval (`T1053.005`). The payload is a compiled-Python binary loading obfuscated bytecode and providing keylogging (`T1056.001`), screenshot and audio capture, USB collection and remote command execution; C2 resilience comes from a pCloud dead-drop resolver (`T1102.001`) that hands out current relay addresses, defeating static domain/IP blocking ([The Hacker News, 2026-06-17](https://thehackernews.com/2026/06/fake-microsoft-alerts-used-to-deploy.html)).

**Why it matters to us:** APT37 targets government, diplomatic, policy-research and Korean-diaspora organisations, including in Europe. The behavioural chain is hunt-friendly without IOCs: alert on `schtasks.exe` creating tasks under an unusual `Microsoft…`-style name from a non-installer parent, on LNK→PowerShell `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` execution trees, and on compiled-Python process images making outbound calls to consumer cloud-storage APIs. Treat the cloud dead-drop pattern as the durable detection surface — blocking one relay does not break C2.
