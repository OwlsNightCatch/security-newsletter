CERT-FR's advisory CERTFR-2026-AVI-0564 (2026-05-12) covers multiple remote code execution flaws in SPIP — the open-source CMS that powers a substantial share of French ministry, université and francophone Swiss canton web sites ([CERT-FR CERTFR-2026-AVI-0564, 2026-05-12](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/avis/CERTFR-2026-AVI-0564/); [SPIP security bulletin, 2026-05-12](https://blog.spip.net/Mise-a-jour-de-securite-sortie-de-SPIP-4-4-14.html)). The SPIP bulletin describes two distinct RCE paths in versions prior to 4.4.14: one in the private (authenticated) area, and one in the public (unauthenticated) area "under specific nginx configurations" — the SPIP bulletin notes the bugs are "not covered by the security screen", meaning they bypass SPIP's built-in filter layer. No CVE identifiers are assigned in the vendor bulletin. Fixed in SPIP 4.4.14. No ITW reported. Detection concepts: monitor SPIP `ecrire/` and front-end access logs for the SSTI / template-load gadget patterns the bulletin enumerates; on shared-host SPIP estates, audit the nginx reverse-proxy configuration for the unsafe location pattern. Hardening: upgrade to 4.4.14; on internet-facing SPIP, gate `ecrire/` to a known admin source set at the reverse proxy.
