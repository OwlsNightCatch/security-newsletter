The Gentlemen — tracked by Microsoft as Storm-2697 and by PRODAFT as Phantom Mantis / LARVA-368 — has claimed 478 victims on its leak site, with victims concentrated in Thailand, the UK, Brazil, Germany and India ([The Hacker News, 2026-06-11](https://thehackernews.com/2026/06/the-gentlemen-ransomware-claims-478.html)). Microsoft's technical dissection details a Go encryptor obfuscated with Garble: per-file ephemeral Curve25519 key pairs with XChaCha20 (the ephemeral public key is appended to each encrypted file after an `--eph--` marker), a `--spread` argument that "turns the malware from a single-host encryptor into a self-propagating worm" — simultaneously abusing network shares, scheduled tasks and remote process execution ([T1021.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002/), [T1053.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005/)) — and a `--full` mode that spawns a SYSTEM-context child via a scheduled task named `gentlemen_system` ([Microsoft Threat Intelligence, 2026-05-28](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/05/28/the-gentlemen-ransomware-dissecting-a-self-propagating-go-encryptor/)). Defence evasion includes disabling Defender real-time monitoring ([T1562.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001/)), re-enabling SMBv1 and registry changes for anonymous share access; persistence runs via `UpdateSystem`/`UpdateUser` scheduled tasks and Run keys. On 10 June, KrebsOnSecurity published a deanonymisation tracing the operator handle "Hastalamuerte"/"Zeta88" to a named Russian national in Izhevsk, corroborated by Intel 471, Constella and Flashpoint ([KrebsOnSecurity, 2026-06-10](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2026/06/who-runs-the-ransomware-group-the-gentlemen/)). Check Point Research documents the affiliate-favourable 90/10 revenue split and reports affiliates obtaining initial access via Fortinet SSL-VPN credentials ([Check Point Research, 2026-05-13](https://research.checkpoint.com/2026/thus-spoke-the-gentlemen/)). Note: Krebs cites 332 published victims since mid-2025 versus the leak site's 478 claim

**Why it matters to us:** the initial-access pattern is concrete and huntable — review Fortinet SSL-VPN authentication logs for brute-force sequences followed by a first-time successful logon from a new ASN; alert on scheduled-task creation named `gentlemen_system`/`UpdateSystem`/`UpdateUser` (Windows Event ID 4698) and on shadow-copy deletion; treat SMBv1 re-enablement on any host as a high-confidence compromise signal.
