The researcher operating as Nightmare Eclipse (also tracked as Chaotic Eclipse) published GreatXML on 11 June — a working proof-of-concept that bypasses BitLocker full-volume encryption and spawns a SYSTEM command prompt inside the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE), with no CVE assigned and no Microsoft patch available ([SecurityWeek, 2026-06-11](https://www.securityweek.com/greatxml-zero-day-exploit-bypasses-bitlocker/)). The technique places a crafted `unattend.xml` at the root of the recovery partition plus a second malformed XML under `Recovery/`, then reboots into WinRE; the Microsoft Defender Offline scan path processes the attacker-controlled XML while the volume is unlocked. Per the researcher, "any Windows machine becomes vulnerable to GreatXML as soon as Defender's offline scanning is initiated" — i.e. the bypass arms itself once an offline scan has ever run on the host ([SecurityWeek, 2026-06-11](https://www.securityweek.com/greatxml-zero-day-exploit-bypasses-bitlocker/)). Independent researcher Will Dormann disputes the practical severity, noting that triggering the prerequisite Defender Offline scan requires an existing Windows logon with admin credentials — an attacker in that position could already disable BitLocker outright ([The Register, 2026-06-11](https://www.theregister.com/security/2026/06/11/nightmare-eclipse-drops-claimed-bitlocker-bypass-for-microsoft-windows/5254371)). NCSC-CH is tracking the disclosure as part of the same researcher's zero-day series (BlueHammer, RedSun, UnDefend, YellowKey, GreenPlasma, RoguePlanet — RoguePlanet covered 2026-06-11) ([NCSC-CH CSH, 2026-06-11](https://security-hub.ncsc.admin.ch/#/posts/12622)). Maps to [T1542.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001/) (Pre-OS Boot) territory: code execution from the recovery path while the BitLocker-protected volume is mounted.

**Why it matters to us:** evil-maid and stolen-laptop scenarios against BitLocker-protected fleets get cheaper where an offline scan has previously run. Until a patch lands: audit recovery-partition contents for unexpected `unattend.xml`/`ReAgent.xml` modifications, require TPM+PIN pre-boot authentication on high-value mobile assets, and weigh `reagentc /disable` on machines where recovery capability is dispensable.
