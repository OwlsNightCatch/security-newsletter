ESET documents two SPECTRALVIPER-delivered OceanLotus (APT32) intrusions running from mid-2024 into 2026: a long-dwell espionage compromise of a Vietnamese infrastructure/transport construction firm (likely via RCE on a public-facing Microsoft SQL Server, [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)) and — more transferable — a supply-chain attack on FireAnt MetaKit, a stock-investment platform, between October 2025 and March 2026 ([ESET WeLiveSecurity, 2026-06-11](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/oceanlotus-external-espionage-domestic-targeting/)). The platform's update mechanism fetched its `version.xml` over plain HTTP with no integrity validation; OceanLotus replaced the update binary with a downloader that fingerprinted hosts and delivered the SPECTRALVIPER backdoor via process injection and DLL side-loading ([T1195.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/002/), [T1055](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/)) to only a small subset of victims — investigative targeting, not mass compromise. ESET's disclosure attempts to the vendor went unanswered. [SINGLE-SOURCE — ESET Research.] Defender takeaway: the pattern (unsigned updates, cleartext transport, no version-file integrity check) is endemic in regional/vertical software far beyond Vietnam — inventory third-party auto-updaters in your estate and flag any fetching over HTTP or lacking signature validation; egress-monitor the hosts that run them.
