Two independent teams published complementary findings against OpenClaw, the self-hosted AI-agent platform that plugs into messaging systems, mailboxes, file systems and APIs. Imperva showed that shared contact names, vCard fields and location-pin labels flow into the LLM prompt with no untrusted-content boundary: a crafted contact — its injected command hidden behind 65 whitespace characters so the UI truncates it — executed `python3` on the victim's host the moment the victim shared the contact with their agent ([Imperva, 2026-06-10](https://www.imperva.com/blog/compromise-openclaw-with-prompt-injections-in-message-objects/)). Varonis demonstrated "agent phishing": a plain email from a plausible sender persuaded a mailbox-connected agent to forward mock AWS IAM keys and a customer export to an external address, with no exploit involved — the agent simply lacks sender-identity verification before acting ([Varonis, 2026-06-09](https://www.varonis.com/blog/openclaw-phishing)). Both teams note OpenClaw's default memory persistence lets one successful injection survive across sessions. The vendor fix (v2026.4.23) moves messaging-object metadata into a separate untrusted channel — but the structural lesson stands: wherever an agent ingests third-party-controlled strings (contacts, calendar invites, ticket bodies), that channel is an injection surface ([T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/)). Defender takeaway: pin OpenClaw ≥ v2026.4.23; inventory which AI agents hold mailbox send-permissions or shell access; gate agent-initiated outbound actions behind approval workflows the same way you gate privileged operations.
