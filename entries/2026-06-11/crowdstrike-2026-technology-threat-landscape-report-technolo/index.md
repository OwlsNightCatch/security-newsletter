CrowdStrike published its 2026 Technology Threat Landscape Report on 9 June 2026 ([CrowdStrike, 2026-06-09](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-2026-technology-threat-landscape-report/)). The findings most relevant to a Swiss/EU public-sector SOC running AI and cloud DevOps infrastructure: China-nexus adversaries (named clusters include MURKY PANDA, MUSTANG PANDA and WARP PANDA) drove more than 58% of state-sponsored intrusions against the technology sector, focused on AI capabilities, training data, ML infrastructure and semiconductor IP; and DPRK-nexus FAMOUS CHOLLIMA accounted for 47% of state-sponsored hands-on-keyboard activity through IT-worker infiltration using AI-enhanced personas and front companies across North America, Europe and Asia. The report frames AI/ML development pipelines and model weights as espionage targets warranting the same protection as source code and credentials. CrowdStrike also names a compromise of the `axios` npm package as part of a DPRK-linked supply-chain operation — a notable claim, but in this run only CrowdStrike asserts it, so treat the `axios` element as single-source pending independent corroboration.
