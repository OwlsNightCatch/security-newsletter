Lumen's Black Lotus Labs reports that the JDY botnet — the reconnaissance cluster that survived the 2024 KV-botnet takedown and is assessed with high confidence to support multiple China-nexus actors including Volt Typhoon — has more than doubled from roughly 650 bots in January 2024 to over 1,500 compromised SOHO and IoT devices ([Lumen Black Lotus Labs, 2026-06-10](https://www.lumen.com/blog/en-us/expanded-jdy-iot-and-soho-botnet-enables-rapid-vulnerability-exploitation)). The botnet now spans Cisco, Araknis, Mimosa Networks, Ubiquiti, Draytek, Hikvision and Linksys devices, performs multiprotocol service fingerprinting, banner-grabbing and TLS-certificate collection at scale, and routes C2 through hidden Tor services while managing victims with the open-source Platypus reverse-shell server. The operationally significant finding: scanning of Fortinet devices spiked within hours of the public disclosure of CVE-2026-35616, demonstrating sub-24-hour integration of new vulnerability intelligence into the recon-to-exploitation pipeline ([The Hacker News, 2026-06-10](https://thehackernews.com/2026/06/china-linked-jdy-botnet-expands-to-1500.html)). Targeting centres on US military and associated entities, with distributed European nodes. Technique mapping: `T1595.002` Active Scanning: Vulnerability Scanning, `T1590` Gather Victim Network Information, `T1584.005` Compromise Infrastructure: Botnet.

**Why it matters to us:** JDY scanning should be treated as a precursor to targeted exploitation, not background noise — the sub-24-hour weaponisation window means CH/EU public-sector and critical-infrastructure operators must compress patch cycles for internet-facing edge appliances to hours, not weeks, after a disclosure. Hunt for outbound connections from edge/SOHO devices to the Platypus default service, unusual high-rate outbound SYN scanning, and unexpected TLS-certificate harvesting.
