Aflac Incorporated filed an SEC Form 8-K on 2026-06-30 disclosing that attackers held unauthorized access to Aflac Life Insurance Japan's policyholder web portal for roughly ten days (2026-06-15 to 2026-06-25) and exfiltrated personal data on approximately 4.38 million customers and agents — names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, gender, authentication details and insurance-account information; a subset of roughly 230,000 individuals also had premium-transfer bank-account details exposed, and no card data was accessed ([SecurityWeek, 2026-06-30](https://www.securityweek.com/aflac-japan-data-breach-impacts-4-38-million/) · [SEC EDGAR 8-K, 2026-06-30](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4977/000162828026046124/0001628280-26-046124-index.htm)). Aflac says the intrusion was contained to Japan-subsidiary systems with US operations unaffected, the affected systems were suspended on discovery, and Japan's Financial Services Agency was notified ([BleepingComputer, 2026-06-30](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/insurance-giant-aflac-discloses-data-breach-after-subsidiary-hack/)). No initial-access vector or actor attribution is stated in any of the disclosures; this is Aflac's second disclosed breach in roughly a year, but the prior US incident's Scattered-Spider-adjacent framing has not been extended to the Japan event.

**Defender takeaway:** the operationally relevant fact is the ~10-day undetected dwell inside a customer-facing portal exfiltrating bulk PII — a pattern to hunt for as sustained anomalous authenticated-session data pulls / API enumeration against public benefits, insurance or citizen-services portals, not a patchable CVE. No IOC or CVE was disclosed; treat as an access-pattern anomaly cue.
