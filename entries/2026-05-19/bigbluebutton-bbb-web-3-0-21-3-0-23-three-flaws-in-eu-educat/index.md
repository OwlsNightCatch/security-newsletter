BigBlueButton (BBB) — the de facto open-source virtual classroom platform deployed across German DFN, Swiss SWITCH, and pan-European GÉANT academic networks, including cantonal school deployments — published three GitHub Security Advisories on 2026-05-17 covering distinct flaws in its `bbb-web` component, all in versions before 3.0.21 (two of three) and 3.0.23 (one). CVE-2026-46351 (CVSS 8.1) is a CWE-330 weakness: the `sessionToken` is generated with insufficiently random values, letting an authenticated low-privilege attacker who shares or has observed a meeting determine other participants' session tokens and impersonate any conference user ([BBB GHSA-7959-pf2v-xc4h, 2026-05-17](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-7959-pf2v-xc4h)). CVE-2026-46353 (CVSS 8.1) is a CWE-284 access-control bypass in the `presentationUploadExternalUrl` endpoint: by supplying specific URL parameters an attacker can bypass checksum validation and send valid API requests to restricted endpoints without proper authentication, with high confidentiality + integrity impact ([BBB GHSA-43hc-5g2m-cqff, 2026-05-17](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-43hc-5g2m-cqff)). CVE-2026-46404 (CVSS 6.8) is a CWE-918 SSRF in presentation URL validation: insufficient redirect-following checks allow a high-privilege authenticated attacker to reach RFC1918 and link-local (169.254.0.0/16) addresses from the BBB server context ([BBB GHSA-xqm3-6q7q-4v5h, 2026-05-17](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/security/advisories/GHSA-xqm3-6q7q-4v5h)). BSI's WID-SEC-2026-1568 corroborated on 2026-05-18 ([BSI WID-SEC-2026-1568, 2026-05-18](https://wid.cert-bund.de/portal/wid/securityadvisory?name=WID-SEC-2026-1568)).

**Why it matters to us:** BBB is operated at scale by Swiss cantonal Volksschule deployments, German Länder ministries of education and university IT, EU national-research-and-education networks (NRENs). The combination of session-token prediction + checksum bypass would let a low-privilege classroom participant impersonate other students and teachers or send arbitrary authenticated API calls; SSRF on the server gives a presenter-role lateral-movement primitive into RFC1918 networks (KVM hosts, internal LDAP, SIS endpoints). Upgrade `bbb-web` to ≥ 3.0.21 for the first two CVEs and ≥ 3.0.23 for the SSRF; monitor `bbb-web` logs for anomalous joins using close-by sessionTokens and for API calls to `presentationUploadExternalUrl` carrying unexpected URL parameters; alert on egress from the BBB server process to RFC1918 / 169.254/16 ranges. MITRE T1212 (Exploitation for Credential Access) covers the session-token-prediction primitive; the SSRF maps to T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) chained with internal-network reach.
