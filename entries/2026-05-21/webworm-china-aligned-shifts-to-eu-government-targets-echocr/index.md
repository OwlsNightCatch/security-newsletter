headline: Webworm (China-aligned) shifts to EU government targets — EchoCreep (Discord C2) and GraphWorm (Microsoft Graph / OneDrive C2) backdoors documented by ESET
summary: "Webworm (China-aligned) targets Belgian, Italian, Serbian and Polish government organisations with two new custom backdoors — EchoCreep (Discord C2) and GraphWorm (Microsoft Graph / OneDrive C2). ESET also documents Spanish and Italian governmental documents exfiltrated to a compromised AWS S3 bucket (ESET Research, 2026-05-20)."

ESET Research published a technical analysis on 2026-05-20 of Webworm — also tracked as FishMonger / Aquatic Panda / SixLittleMonkeys / Space Pirates — documenting a 2025 campaign pivot to European governmental organisations in Belgium, Italy, Serbia and Poland, plus a South African university; the group has abandoned its prior primary backdoors (Trochilus RAT, McRat / 9002 RAT) in favour of two new custom implants — EchoCreep (which ESET describes as written in Go) and GraphWorm ([ESET WeLiveSecurity, 2026-05-20](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/webworm-new-burrowing-techniques/)). **EchoCreep** uses Discord as a bidirectional C2 channel, encoding commands with base64 + AES-CBC-128; it creates per-victim Discord channels named after the victim IP (or IP+hostname), supports file upload/download and `cmd.exe` command execution, and ESET recovered 433 decrypted Discord messages dating back to 2024-03-21 from four unique victim channels (`T1102.002` Web Service: Bidirectional Communication, `T1059.003` Windows Command Shell). **GraphWorm** is more capable: an implant (implementation language not stated in the ESET write-up) that authenticates against the Microsoft Graph API and uses per-victim OneDrive directories for C2, with `/createUploadSession` for large-file exfiltration and AES-256-CBC + base64 encoding on uploaded data (`T1102.002`, `T1071.001` Application Layer Protocol — Web Protocols); it persists at logon and spawns `cmd.exe` sessions under the implant's process context. The custom proxy toolkit added in 2025 includes **WormFrp** (a modified `frp` that pulls its config from a compromised AWS S3 bucket `wamanharipethe.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com`), **ChainWorm** (multi-hop chaining), **SmuxProxy**, and **WormSocket** (`socket.io`-based proxy); a **SharpSecretsdump** Impacket-look-alike credential dumper was uploaded to the same S3 bucket in October 2025 (`T1003.001` OS Credential Dumping: LSASS Memory) ([ESET, 2026-05-20](https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/webworm-new-burrowing-techniques/); [The Hacker News, 2026-05-20](https://thehackernews.com/2026/05/webworm-deploys-echocreep-and-graphworm.html)). Files exfiltrated from victims and staged in the S3 bucket included virtual-machine snapshots from an Italian governmental entity and an mRemoteNG connection-configuration file plus a Microsoft Visio infrastructure diagram from a Spanish governmental entity — both documents that materially aid follow-on intrusion. Initial-access tradecraft documented against Serbian targets used CVE-2017-7692 (SquirrelMail post-auth RCE), implying credential theft preceded webmail exploitation. **Why it matters to us:** the cloud-API C2 design (Discord, Microsoft Graph) blends with legitimate enterprise traffic and defeats domain / URL block-lists. Detection concept — alert on Sysmon EID 3 outbound HTTPS to `discord.com/api/*` or `graph.microsoft.com` from process trees whose parent is not the expected first-party application (`Discord.exe`, `Teams.exe`, `OneDrive.exe`, Office); correlate Graph API non-interactive sign-ins in Entra ID for app registrations with no enterprise approval path; flag `cmd.exe` spawned by long-running services with no interactive user context. Hardening — Conditional Access for the Microsoft Graph application restricting non-managed device sign-ins; block `socket.io` and Discord WebSocket outbound at the SWG for server workloads that have no business reason; force first-party-only WebSocket egress on government-segment workstations.
