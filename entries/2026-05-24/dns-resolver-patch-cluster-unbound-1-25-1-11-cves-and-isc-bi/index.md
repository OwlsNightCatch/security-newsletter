Two of the most widely deployed open-source DNS resolvers shipped coordinated security releases on 2026-05-20. **NLnet Labs Unbound 1.25.1** fixes 11 CVEs; the headline issue is CVE-2026-33278 (CWE-416 use-after-free; CVSS 9.8 per CCB Belgium), where a struct-assignment bug overwrites a destination pointer during deep-copying of DS sub-query structures when NSEC3 budget exhaustion forces a suspend — a remote unauthenticated attacker who controls a DNSSEC-signed domain can crash the daemon or potentially execute code (affected 1.19.1–1.25.0) ([NLnet Labs, 2026-05-20](https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/CVE-2026-33278.txt)). CVE-2026-42944 (heap overflow, CVSS 7.5 per CCB Belgium) is reachable in the default configuration — `answer-cookie` and `pad-responses` are on by default — when a reply encodes multiple NSID / DNS-Cookie / EDNS-Padding options ([CCB Belgium, 2026-05-20](https://ccb.belgium.be/advisories/warning-nlnet-labs-has-addressed-multiple-vulnerabilities-unbound-dns-resolver-could)). **ISC BIND** 9.18.49 / 9.20.23 fix CVE-2026-3593 (CVSS 7.4 use-after-free in the DoH/HTTP-2 path; 9.20.x only, 9.18.x lacks DoH) and CVE-2026-5946 (CVSS 7.5 DoS — a single query bearing a non-Internet CLASS such as CHAOS/HESIOD or an ANY/NONE meta-class crashes `named` in the NOTIFY/UPDATE/recursion paths, affecting the very widely deployed 9.18 branch) ([ISC, 2026-05-20](https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2026-5946)).

No in-the-wild exploitation or public PoC is reported for any of these as of the advisories. They earn § 2 placement on the combination of CVSS-9.8 pre-auth memory-safety reach and the ubiquity of these resolvers across EU/CH government, ISP and critical-infrastructure DNS. Detection is limited to crash telemetry — `unbound` / `named` dying with SIGSEGV/SIGABRT in `dnssec_*` or `http_*` / `isc_tls_*` frames, or `named` crashing immediately after a CHAOS/HESIOD/ANY-class query. Patch recursive and authoritative infrastructure to Unbound 1.25.1, BIND 9.18.49 or 9.20.23.
