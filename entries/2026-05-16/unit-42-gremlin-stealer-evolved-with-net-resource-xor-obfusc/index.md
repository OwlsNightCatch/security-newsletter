Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 published on 2026-05-15 an analysis of evolved variants of the Gremlin information stealer, adding three new capability tiers operationally relevant to defenders running endpoint detections tuned for older Gremlin samples ([Palo Alto Networks Unit 42, 2026-05-15](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/gremlin-stealer-evolution/)). Obfuscation has shifted to embedding encrypted payloads in .NET resource sections (XOR-keyed) combined with single- or double-character identifier renaming and a runtime string-decoder function (`_003CModule_003E.c()`) — defeating static signature analysis of string literals that previous-generation Gremlin samples used. A new crypto-clipper component continuously monitors the system clipboard and replaces Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses with attacker-controlled equivalents in real time, [T1115](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1115/). The most operationally interesting addition is a WebSocket-based session-hijack module that reads active browser process memory (Chrome-based browsers) to extract session tokens directly from running processes, bypassing the cookie-encryption mitigations modern browsers apply at disk — [T1185](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1185/) Browser Session Hijacking. Credential scope includes browser cookies, session tokens, saved passwords, payment-card details, FTP and VPN credentials, Discord tokens (dedicated regex scanner), clipboard content, and cryptocurrency wallet files. Exfiltration is HTTPS POST to a private web panel; a Telegram Bot API channel is the secondary channel. Detection: Sysmon EID 10 (process access) targeting `chrome.exe` or `msedge.exe` (and other Chrome-based browser processes) from unexpected parent processes; clipboard-monitoring hook registration from non-standard processes (generic Windows clipboard-listener API surface). Hardening: browser isolation for high-value sessions; clipboard-API access audited in EDR telemetry. Single-source — Unit 42 only; flagged for verification.
