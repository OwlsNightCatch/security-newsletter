Unit 42 detailed an architectural attack abusing the global uniqueness of object-storage bucket names across AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage and (less so) Azure Blob Storage ([Unit 42, 2026-06-22](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/cloud-bucket-hijacking-risks/)). An actor holding bucket-delete rights deletes a destination bucket and immediately recreates it under their own account; existing log sinks, replication jobs, Pub/Sub-to-Storage subscriptions and Data Firehose streams keep writing to the now attacker-owned bucket with no config change and no entry in the source account's audit trail. No named in-the-wild exploitation is reported — this is offensive-research surfacing of an exposure class — but the impact on audit-log integrity is exactly what a SOC's detection pipeline depends on. `[SINGLE-SOURCE]` (Unit 42, a vendor lab, so the national-CERT carve-out does not apply; the underlying CSP behaviours are independently verifiable). Detection: alert on storage bucket-deletion API calls (GCP `storage.buckets.delete`, AWS CloudTrail `DeleteBucket`, Azure `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/delete`) and on recreation of sink/replication targets; hardening: require multi-party approval for bucket deletion, enforce GCP VPC Service Controls / AWS account-region namespace isolation, and track sensitive-bucket ownership with DSPM. Maps to `T1485`/`T1578` (resource manipulation) and the effective outcome of `T1530` (data from cloud storage).
