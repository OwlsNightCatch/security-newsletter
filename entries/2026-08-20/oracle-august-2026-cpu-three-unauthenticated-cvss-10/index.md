summary: >
  Oracle published its August 2026 Critical Security Patch Update — its monthly release, distinct from the
  quarterly cumulative Critical Patch Update — on 2026-08-18 with 943 new security patches, and Switzerland's
  NCSC relayed it to its own constituency the following day. Three flaws in the release carry a
  CVSS 3.1 base score of 10.0 with Privileges Required and User Interaction both None in Oracle's own risk
  matrix: CVE-2026-61241 in the LDAP server of Oracle Internet Directory, and CVE-2026-70880 and CVE-2026-70921
  in Hyperion Data Relationship Management and Hyperion Financial Management. Fusion Middleware alone accounts
  for 262 patches of which Oracle states 182 may be remotely exploitable without authentication, and E-Business
  Suite for 120 of which 27 may be. No flaw in this cycle is reported as exploited by any source.

Oracle published its August 2026 Critical Security Patch Update on 2026-08-18, stating that it "contains 943 new security patches across the product families listed below" ([Oracle, 2026-08-18](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cspuaug2026.html)); Switzerland's NCSC put it in front of its own constituency the next day ([NCSC-CH, 2026-08-19](https://security-hub.ncsc.admin.ch/#/posts/12862)). This is worth naming precisely, because the release type sets the patch window: a Critical Security Patch Update is Oracle's monthly release — the page states that security patches ship on the third Tuesday of each month and lists 15 September 2026 as the next one — and it is a distinct thing from the quarterly cumulative Critical Patch Update it complements, the next of which is 20 October 2026 ([Oracle, 2026-08-18](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cspuaug2026.html)). An estate that treats this as the quarterly cycle will both misjudge how soon the next batch lands and, more importantly, wait a quarter for fixes that are already out. Most of a release this size is still routine maintenance; what takes a handful of items past routine is their own mechanics, and those are not in the families with the largest counts.

Three CVEs in the release carry a CVSS 3.1 base score of 10.0, and in Oracle's own risk matrices all three record Privileges Required as None, User Interaction as None, and Scope as Changed — an anonymous, single-request path to full compromise of the component and beyond it. CVE-2026-61241 is in the OID LDAP Server component of Oracle Internet Directory, reachable over LDAP, affecting versions 12.2.1.4.0 and 14.1.2.1.0. The other two, CVE-2026-70880 and CVE-2026-70921, are in the Access and security component of Hyperion Data Relationship Management (reachable over TCP) and the Security component of Hyperion Financial Management (reachable over TLS), both at 11.2.25.0.000 ([Oracle, 2026-08-18](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cspuaug2026.html)). The Internet Directory flaw is the one that should move first in a public-sector estate: an LDAP directory server is identity infrastructure, it is normally reachable from every application that authenticates against it, and a scope-changed compromise of it is not contained to the directory.

The concentration behind those three is what makes the sequencing work non-trivial. Oracle records 262 new patches for Fusion Middleware, of which it states 182 "may be remotely exploitable without authentication", and 120 for E-Business Suite, of which 27 may be; Hyperion carries 262 patches with 107 in that category ([Oracle, 2026-08-18](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cspuaug2026.html)). Within E-Business Suite the two highest-scored unauthenticated flaws sit on inbound processing paths that an internet-facing deployment exposes by design — CVE-2026-60782 in the File Transmission component of Oracle Payments over HTTP, and CVE-2026-70926 in the Workflow Notification Mailer over SMTP, both 9.8. In Fusion Middleware, CVE-2026-60672 is an unauthenticated 9.8 in the WebLogic Server core reachable over T3 and IIOP, a protocol pair with a long history of public exploit work following Oracle releases.

No source fetched this run reports exploitation of any individual flaw in this cycle, and NCSC-CH's relay records exploitation status as unknown for the batch as a whole ([NCSC-CH, 2026-08-19](https://security-hub.ncsc.admin.ch/#/posts/12862)). Oracle's own advisory makes the point that matters more than any single score: it "continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches" ([Oracle, 2026-08-18](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cspuaug2026.html)). For estates that cannot patch 943 items at once, the useful hardening step in the meantime is network placement rather than version: T3, IIOP, RMI, CORBA and LDAP listeners on middleware and directory hosts have no business being reachable from a general-purpose user network, and restricting them removes the reachability half of every unauthenticated flaw in this release regardless of which one is patched first.

**Defender takeaway:** treat this release as three out-of-band items wrapped in a routine monthly one. Patch the two Hyperion components and Oracle Internet Directory on the schedule you would give an emergency advisory, then work the rest of Fusion Middleware and E-Business Suite by whether the affected component listens on a network anyone untrusted can reach. The absence of an exploitation report for a flaw that needs no credential and no interaction is a statement about the present, not a property of the flaw.
