summary: >
  Mitel PSIRT advisory MISA-2026-0006, republished by CERT-FR, patches an unauthenticated command-injection flaw
  (CVSS 9.8) in the Audio, Web and Video Conferencing (AWV) component of on-prem MiCollab that lets a
  network-reachable attacker execute arbitrary OS commands with no authentication or user interaction. No CVE is
  assigned yet (internal id MTLVULN-1694); no exploitation is reported, but the product class has a track record.

Mitel's PSIRT advisory **MISA-2026-0006** (2026-07-22, republished by CERT-FR as CERTFR-2026-AVI-0911 the next day) addresses a critical command-injection vulnerability, internally tracked as MTLVULN-1694 with a CVE requested but not yet assigned, in the **Audio, Web, and Video Conferencing (AWV)** component of on-premises MiCollab ([Mitel, 2026-07-22](https://www.mitel.com/support/security-advisories/mitel-product-security-advisory-misa-2026-0006)). Per Mitel, insufficient parameter sanitisation in the AWV component lets an unauthenticated attacker inject and execute arbitrary OS commands — rated CVSS 3.1 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), meaning network-reachable, no credentials and no user interaction ([Mitel, 2026-07-22](https://www.mitel.com/support/security-advisories/mitel-product-security-advisory-misa-2026-0006)). Affected releases run from 10.0.0.26 up to and including 10.2 SP1 FP2 (10.2.1.205) and 9.8 SP3 FP2 (9.8.3.203) and earlier; the fix ships in MiCollab 10.3.0.18, with Mitel-provided backport patches for the 10.2 SP1 FP2 and 9.8 SP3 FP2 branches (KB000128275) ([CERT-FR, 2026-07-23](https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/avis/CERTFR-2026-AVI-0911/)). Neither Mitel nor CERT-FR reports exploitation at publication.

**Defender takeaway:** MiCollab is a widely-deployed unified-communications and conferencing platform across European public-sector and enterprise voice estates, and its AWV component is frequently internet-exposed for external conferencing — exactly the surface that pre-auth command-injection targets. The absence of a CVE identifier is a tracking inconvenience, not a reason to defer: this is an out-of-band vendor advisory for an unauthenticated RCE on an appliance class with prior real-world exploitation (an earlier MiCollab unauthenticated RCE was exploited in the wild in 2025), so any internet-reachable AWV instance is a priority patch even before a public proof-of-concept or scanning appears. Where the patch cannot be applied immediately, restrict network reachability of the AWV conferencing interface to trusted networks and watch web/application access logs on that component for anomalous parameter values preceding process-execution telemetry (a web-tier process spawning a shell interpreter is the behavioural signature of successful command injection).
