The extortion group **BravoX** — a Ransomware-as-a-Service operation first profiled on the RAMP underground forum in January 2026, which vets affiliates and by convention avoids CIS-based victims ([SOCRadar, 2026-01-26](https://socradar.io/blog/dark-web-profile-bravox-ransomware/)) — breached an accounting/fiduciary firm in Yverdon-les-Bains (canton Vaud) around 30 June 2026, and on 18 July published roughly 220 GB (over 100,000 files) on its Tor leak site ([Le Temps, 2026-07-22](https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/vaud/le-piratage-d-une-fiduciaire-vaudoise-expose-sur-le-dark-web-100-000-dossiers-de-clients-dont-celui-d-un-conseiller-d-etat)). The firm's own account describes a "connection problem" to its server that led its IT provider to isolate affected systems, revoke compromised access and restore from an external backup; no negotiation took place and no ransom was paid ([Le Temps, 2026-07-22](https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/vaud/le-piratage-d-une-fiduciaire-vaudoise-expose-sur-le-dark-web-100-000-dossiers-de-clients-dont-celui-d-un-conseiller-d-etat)). The leaked dataset spans individuals, businesses and institutions, and includes administrative and tax records of some fifteen Nord Vaudois municipalities (Corcelles-près-Concise and Belmont-sur-Yverdon among those named) and the personal tax file of Vaud State Councillor Vassilis Venizelos and his spouse ([24 heures, 2026-07-23](https://www.24heures.ch/cyberattaque-les-donnees-fiscales-de-vassilis-venizelos-fuitent-454052188828)). The firm filed a criminal complaint and notified both the cantonal data-protection commissioner and the Federal Office for Cybersecurity (BACS/OFCS) — Switzerland's mandatory critical-incident reporting channel ([24 heures, 2026-07-23](https://www.24heures.ch/cyberattaque-les-donnees-fiscales-de-vassilis-venizelos-fuitent-454052188828)).

**Defender takeaway:** No government network was touched — the exposure of cantonal and municipal data ran entirely through a private supplier holding tax and administrative records on public administration's behalf. Swiss cantonal and municipal security teams should treat their outsourced fiduciary, accounting and payroll providers as in-scope for the personal and fiscal data those providers process, and confirm those firms carry incident-reporting obligations, tested offline backups (which limited this firm's operational impact) and data-protection notification duties in contract. The exposure is structural, not incidental: the municipal outsourcing model for fiduciary and accounting services concentrates cantonal and municipal personal and tax data inside private firms whose security posture the public bodies do not directly control.
