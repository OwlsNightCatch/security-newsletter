SANS ISC handler Manuel Humberto Santander Pelaez published a forensic walkthrough on 2026-05-27 reconstructing an Akira ransomware intrusion using only two log sources — SSLVPN syslog and Windows EVTX exports — joined by source IP and normalised time ([SANS Internet Storm Center, 2026-05-27](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/33024)). **[SINGLE-SOURCE]** — high-reliability technical primary, but no independent corroboration of the specific kill chain. Initial access (`T1078.001` / `T1133`): non-distributed brute force from a single hosting-provider IP against a single local SSLVPN account that had been deprovisioned in Active Directory but remained provisioned as a local firewall user with no MFA. Discovery: EID 4688 captures `nltest.exe /dclist:`, `net.exe group "Domain Admins" /domain`, `net.exe group "Enterprise Admins" /domain`, `whoami.exe /all`, and a renamed `AdFind.exe` variant, all parented `explorer.exe → cmd.exe`. Credential access (`T1558.003` Kerberoasting): a cluster of EID 4769 RC4-encrypted TGS requests for multiple SPNs from a single workstation within a 90-second window. Lateral movement (`T1021.001`): EID 4624 Logon Type 10 chain from jump host to file server, domain controllers, backup server; EID 4672 special-logon privileges on DC. Defense evasion + impact: EID 1102 security-log clear; `sc.exe` / `net stop` of endpoint-protection services (System EID 7036); `vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet`.

**Why it matters to us:** the diary is a forensic-primer for any SOC operating without full EDR coverage — the standard scenario in smaller public-sector entities and DACH commune networks. Concrete takeaways the SANS ISC author makes directly: reconcile local SSLVPN account directories against AD source-of-truth (`deprovisioned-in-AD-but-retained-in-firewall` is the recurring initial-access pathway in this class); alert on > 50 failed SSLVPN auths from a single source per hour; enable EID 4688 process auditing on every Windows host, set Security log size ≥ 1 GB; alert on RC4 TGS-REP (EID 4769 `EncryptionType=0x17`) for multiple SPNs from one workstation in a short window; EID 1102 security-log clear is incident-grade in every case; time-sync every host including the firewall to the same NTP source so perimeter-to-endpoint joins remain reliable.
