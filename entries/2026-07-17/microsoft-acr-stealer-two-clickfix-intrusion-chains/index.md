  blockchain dead-drop for C2 resolution. Chain 2 is fileless: mshta.exe fetches an HTA that runs in-memory
  PowerShell and extracts an encrypted payload steganographically hidden in a downloaded JPEG. Both converge on
  DPAPI-based theft of Chromium-based browser credential stores plus enumeration of M365/OneDrive documents.

Microsoft Defender Experts documented two ACR Stealer delivery campaigns observed across customer environments from late April to mid-June 2026; ACR Stealer is a malware-as-a-service infostealer Microsoft states is "reportedly ... associated with the rebranding of Amatera Stealer" ([Microsoft Threat Intelligence, 2026-07-16](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2026/07/16/acr-stealer-two-observed-intrusion-chains-amid-increased-threat-activity/)). Both begin with the same ClickFix lure (malvertising/SEO poisoning) but diverge sharply. In Chain 1 the ClickFix command spawns `cmd.exe`, which invokes `rundll32.exe` to load a DLL from a remote WebDAV share over HTTPS using a GUID-based directory structure disguised as legitimate resources; the most evasive variant launches through `conhost.exe --headless` with delayed-expansion obfuscation. A heavily obfuscated PowerShell stage downloads a ZIP into a masqueraded `%LocalAppData%\Temp` directory (e.g. "LogiOptionsPlus"), runs a bundled `pythonw.exe`, persists via a hidden scheduled task disguised as a software update, timestomps against `notepad.exe` and clears PowerShell history; a subset adds an "EtherHiding" loader that queries public blockchain RPC endpoints as a dead-drop resolver so infrastructure can rotate without redeploying malware. Chain 2 is fileless throughout: `mshta.exe` fetches remote HTA content whose VBScript decodes and launches in-memory PowerShell, and its distinguishing technique is steganographic delivery — a JPEG pulled from an image host carries an encrypted payload in its pixel data, decrypted and executed in memory via runtime-resolved `LoadLibrary`/`VirtualAlloc`/`CreateThread`. Both chains converge on DPAPI-based decryption of Chromium-based browser credential stores (passwords, cookies, auth tokens) plus enumeration of PDFs, M365 documents and OneDrive/SharePoint-synced data for exfiltration.

**Defender takeaway:** signature-based detection degrades against the in-memory and steganographic stages, so hunt the two chains' host artifacts, which Microsoft supplies KQL for. Chain 1's RunMRU registry pattern is highly specific — a WebDAV `@ssl` path combined with a GUID (8-4-4-4-12 hex) directory segment invoked through `rundll32` or `pushd` — as is the persistence scheduled task masquerading as an "Autoupdate" with a numeric suffix. Chain 2's anchor is `mshta.exe` launched by a non-interactive PowerShell parent that was itself spawned from `explorer.exe`. **Triage:** legitimate WebDAV use does not produce a RunMRU entry combining `@ssl` with a GUID directory invoked via `rundll32`, and `mshta.exe` is not normally a child of PowerShell — either pattern, captured in registry-modification and process-creation telemetry with parent lineage, separates this activity from benign administrative scripting regardless of the EDR/SIEM in use.
